      "content_html": "<p>I just finished <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/intel-trinity-how-robert-noyce-gordon-moore-and-andy-grove-built-the-worlds-most-important-company/oclc/878945165&amp;referer=brief_results\">The Intel Trinity</a>. It’s the story of Intel and it’s founders Andy Grove, Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore. There’s an incredible amount to unpack but I can’t stop thinking of this one vignette of Grove, then a new immigrant and struggling at university:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“even as he was trying to make sense of what the professor was saying, he would look around at his classmates and see them casually taking notes as if the material on the blackboard was entirely self-evident.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Then, when his despair was at its lowest, an amazing thing happened. Try as he might, Andy found that he couldn’t follow the logic of a particular proof being written on the board, so he raised his hand and asked about it. The professor paused, looked at what he’d written, and realized he’d made a mistake. He went back and corrected it. As Andy watched, his fellow students erased and corrected their notes with the same aplomb.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It was an epiphany for Andy Grove, “because I discovered ‘<strong>these toads don’t know any more than I do. They just don’t dare speak up</strong>. To hell with them.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fear of being “found out”, of being seen not to know, I think, is far more common than we’d like to admit. It affects and costs us all.</p>\n<p>One area this bites us, what I’ve been reflecting on, is journalism. We’ve all read the stories or watched interviews that seem to take place at 20,000 feet. That skips first principles and takes a lot as given.</p>\n<p>Everyone has ideas for why journalism is broken but this is a big one for me: a lot of journalists are scared of appearing stupid or unsophisticated. In front of their audience and also (maybe moreso) their colleagues.</p>\n<p>They don’t ask simple questions because they don’t want to appear simple. They frame stories from a position of their own savvyness. They gatekeep with clever ‘gotchas’.</p>\n<p>We lose from this in a couple of ways. One is that we’re not all making the same logical leaps, and so failing to start from first principles will leave many behind.</p>\n<p>But I think where Grove’s example is even more illustrative is that without the willingness for one to look stupid they would have all been wrong. No one would have challenged the received wisdom.</p>\n<p>Signalling cleverness with silence, or going along with the pack, means you aren’t questioning whether it should be so.</p>\n<p>I love reading stories like this because they remind me that even people like Andy Grove were once unconfident and on the outside. And maybe one of the reasons they were able to affect the world is that they weren’t afraid to look stupid.</p>\n<p><em>(My emphasis)</em></p>\n",

And I think it’s because I’ve been consuming, not learning.</p><br /><p>There’s a lot wrong with formal education. But besides the pieces of paper you get at the end (the currency of Human Resources), the best of formal education is the guidance of someone who has achieved mastery. Especially, guidance (compulsion) to practice.</p><br /><p>Most online resources I’ve come across are instead geared around consumption. Even if there’s a “curriculum” there’s rarely an emphasis on practice. On building reps. Rarer still are explorations of what makes effective practice.</p><br /><p>At best this is a recipe for mere familiarity. At worst it leads to stagnation, frustration and abandonment.</p><br /><p>They aren’t all like this. When I was an undergrad I did a lot of Khan Academy to brush up on maths. There were seemingly endless practice problems and you couldn’t progress until you showed some level of “mastery”.</p><br /><p>This seems obvious for a well trod, ostensibly linear path like maths. But repetition is the basis for learning pretty much anything. And it’s missing from a lot of the internet’s learning materials.</p><br /><p>In the past couple of years I’ve gone deep on painting and drawing. YouTube has a fantastic catalogue of art videos, as do platforms like Skillshare or Domestika.</p><br /><p>But you’re more likely to go down a rabbit hole of product reviews as anything else. My first months of painting were a mess of Amazon packages as I tried different brands and gadgets, even as my skills largely stagnated.</p><br /><p>One of the longest videos in a course I recently purchased was about the teacher’s favourite tools. It was almost twice as long as the video on <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)\">perspective</a>.</p><br /><p>Even when there are exercises attached to the lessons, there is often little on how to make it generalisable. How to self critique and correct.</p><br /><p>The breadth of my knowledge of watercolour brands is now truly staggering. I own some really expensive brushes. But, years into my watercolour journey, I’m still unsure how I should practice.</p><br /><p>Because I’ve been consuming, not learning.</p><br />",

She won a Nobel prize for her work on <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR\">CRISPR</a>.</p><br /><p>Almost immediately we run into her being an outsider as a child, her diverse interests. Her <strong>curiosity</strong>.</p><br /><blockquote>“Her work also illustrates, as Leonardo da Vinci’s did, that the key to innovation is <strong>connecting a curiosity</strong> about basic science to the practical work of devising tools that can be applied to our lives - moving discoveries from lab bench to bedside.”</blockquote><p>CRISPR is something I know little about, bar a half remembered Radio Lab episode from a few years ago. So I’m really excited to read more, and whether this pays off.</p><br /><p>But this does look promising:</p><br /><blockquote>“Curiosity-driven research into the wonders of nature plants the seeds, sometimes in unpredictable ways, for later innovations. Research about surface-state physics eventually led to the transistor and microchip. Likewise, studies of an astonishing method that bacteria use to fight off viruses eventually led to a gene-editing tool and techniques that humans can use in their own struggle against viruses.”</blockquote>",

But it’s a great example of a simple inversion of a “common sense” idea. And the power of, and need for, different framing.</p><br /><p>But a side note in the book is what has really captured my thinking the past few days:</p><br /><blockquote>There was debate in the chess world at the time surrounding the best strategies for improving. One camp thought tournament play was crucial, as it provides practice with tight time limits and working through distractions. The other camp, however, emphasized serious study—pouring over books and using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses. When surveyed, the participants in Charness’s study thought tournament play was probably the right answer. <strong>The participants, as it turns out, were wrong</strong>. Hours spent in serious study of the game was not just the most important factor in predicting chess skill, it dominated the other factors.</blockquote><p>That we don’t fully understand or appreciate the reasons for successes (or failures) is something I’ve often returned to <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/\">since reading The Hidden Half</a>.</p><br /><p>That book largely focused on noise and unknowability. Newport concentrates on poor framing and mental capture.</p><br /><p>I started reading <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/serendipity-mindset-the-art-and-science-of-creating-good-lu/oclc/1199009413&amp;referer=brief_results\">The Serendipity Mindset</a> this morning and came across yet another spin. This is a book largely focused on luck (“serendipity”), and our perceptions of it.</p><br /><blockquote>The point is that when we construct our story of past events, we do what forecasters do: we create a model and ignore the details and the random events. Forecasters have a good excuse for doing this with the future: they cannot model every detail and, by definition, cannot foresee unpredictable events. But what is our excuse for doing this with the past?..</blockquote><blockquote>...We downplay or exclude the unpredictable events from our version of the past because <strong>random events that happened are no longer unpredictable</strong>. In fact, in hindsight they can start to look like they were inevitable. We then use information that wasn’t available to us at the time, and construct narratives that conveniently explain everything, including how each piece of the story logically connects with the rest of the story.</blockquote><p>The overarching thread is the stories we tell ourselves are wrong. Whether due to an inability to perceive, ingrained misdirection, motivated reasoning, an uncomfortableness with randomness, post hoc rationalisation, or something else.</p><br /><p>Eyewitness accounts seem to receive less and less credence as evidence of flaws mount. But perhaps all stories should be treated thus.</p><br />",

      "content_html": "<p>I recently got the results for my latest masters courses and I’m doing pretty well. But I don’t <em>really</em> care. I’ve never been particularly motivated by grades. As long as they are high enough that I can keep studying whatever I want.</p><br /><p>The results came as I started reading <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/bigger-prize-why-competition-isnt-everything-and-how-we-do-better/oclc/896906563&amp;referer=brief_results\">A bigger prize</a> by Margaret Heffernan. It’s a deep dive into competition. Specifically, the way we have unquestioningly inserted competition into so many aspects of life even as we keep discovering the benefits (to creativity, health, equality etc.) of cooperation.</p><br /><p>In one early chapter Heffernan describes an experiment into kids’ motivation at school. And it really stopped me short. Wondering how I had lucked into an intrinsic motivation to learn, rather than needing to be baited with gold stars.</p><br /><blockquote>In the original experiment, a bunch of nursery school children were divided into three groups and given the opportunity to draw. The first group was promised a reward: if they drew, they’d win a certificate. The second group was told nothing – but was surprised by a certificate when it had finished drawing. The third group just drew and received nothing for its labours. Two weeks later, the children were again confronted by paper and pens. Now the question was: which group would want to draw? The group that had initially been promised a reward was the least engaged: <strong>why should they draw when there was no certificate on offer</strong>?</blockquote><blockquote>Similar experiments have been conducted with different ages, tasks and rewards, in different industries and countries around the world, but the results don’t vary. Grades, stars, certificates, money, trophies: ‘<strong>virtually every type of expected tangible reward made contingent on task performance does, in fact, undermine intrinsic motivation</strong>.’</blockquote><p>This quickly feeds into rumination on divergent thinking, the problems with exams, and the link between education and creativity. But I’d like to stop here for now.</p><br /><p>I need to look more into these studies. They seem directionally in line with what we see in society. Most people seem to stop learning when they finish school or university. Outside of that a lot is probably motivated by specific goals - qualifying for a job etc. But is this because we have subconsciously trained people to require short term positive reinforcement in order to learn?</p><br /><p>Even the HBR-esque calls for lifelong learning are couched in these terms. I rarely ever see advocates for learning because learning itself is good. Education is expensive, fair enough. But its precisely the non-rewards-based education that is the cheapest. Wikipedia is almost free, for example.</p><br /><p>Heffernan’s solution is to overhaul the structure of schools to remove aspects like testing, ranking and their links to teacher pay. Eliminate some of the competition, as is the main thrust of her book. But I’m not sure I completely buy it. I don’t know what the answer is.</p><br /><p><em>My emphasis.</em></p><br />",

It was where the Buddha’s topknots came from; it was where the monk painters of illuminated manuscripts found their skies; it was where the robe of Michelangelo’s Mother of God would have come from if he had waited long enough. And it was where I was determined to go.</blockquote><p>Wars were fought over shades. Masterpieces left incomplete when artists couldn’t afford particular hues. Espionage was rampant as countries competed for monopolies.</p><br /><p>This is a fascinating book, part travelogue part history. Finlay physically journeys to find ochre in Northern Australia, cochineal insect farms in South America, and the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan.</p><br /><p>But I was probably taken most with what’s lost. Many of the works lining our national galleries have changed since they were completed. Natural pigment often isn’t permanent. And nor are the techniques to make them.</p><br /><p>I carry around a little box of watercolours nowadays. In case I can get in a quick sketch. But now I realise they’re more than burnt umbers or cerulean blue. It’s a box of stories.</p><br />",

For now, the treehouses stand empty, waiting for the eventual return of the employees who have been working from home for months.</blockquote><p>I've never been to Seattle. I've seen it on tv and in movies, but these sketches and explorations ground it as more than a backdrop. Some of it is the focus on the <em>mundane</em>, like markets, bookstores and small parks.</p><br /><p>Sketching and watercolour capture moments in time. But unlike photography they force the creator to be present for an extended period. To measure, estimate and contrast. To notice little details and features most of us walk past every day.</p><br /><p>And, consequently, they force the viewer to do these things too.</p><br /><p>Campanario has used this to document <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/life/10-sketches-that-show-how-seattle-has-changed-over-the-last-decade/\">change</a>, explore <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/life/two-opposing-buildings-on-this-capitol-hill-street-tell-the-story-of-new-vs-old-seattle-at-one-glance/\">class</a> and highlight <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/life/this-hidden-park-in-tacoma-honors-the-journey-chinese-immigrants-took-to-the-united-states/\">microhistories</a> throughout Seattle. The buildings, the infrastructure, are themselves the characters. Just as they are in our lives.</p><br /><p>Pen and brush can explore lines, space, value and visual juxtaposition. They can exaggerate and simplify. In ways others just don't have to. In ways others can't. That is the strength of this column. But Campanario's work is also an example of what we've lost as media companies have shrunk, as stories have become faster, more national and international.</p><br /><p>How many others are there with the license to slowly explore and document our built world? Our local world? How many stories are we missing?</p><br />",

I located the vanishing point and traced perspective lines along the rooftops and windows.

This is a new one for me.</p><br /><p>I’ve been <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/why-cant-you-draw/\">reading</a> and watching a lot on sketching and drawing recently. But even as my scribbles have <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/flowerpot2/\">improved somewhat</a>, my whole approach has apparently, drastically, changed. I think about it more. I consider the process.</p><br /><p>I’ve been frustrated at my slow progress. Even as I manically draw box figures and practice laying down values. But while my eye, dexterity and muscle memory aren’t there, I have come a long way. My perspective has changed.</p><br /><p>It’s really easy to be caught up with the ending and ignore the journey. <em>Resultism</em>, I think it’s called. “Lifelong learning” is steeped in credentialism and “if you learn X you can finally do Y”.

      "content_html": "<blockquote>All art is an artist’s attempt to share their consciousness with others...</blockquote><p>Is it, though? Or, rather, is that why we consume and value art? This quote is from a brilliant <a href=\"https://medium.com/mutualart/the-trouble-with-ken-griffins-basquiat-5f82477ca303\">Medium</a> piece I've been thinking about the last few days.</p><br /><p>Is the reason we consume art because we value the intention behind it? Put another way, is it about the agency of the creator? Is it about the viewers? Or, once let out into the world, does art take on something separate from either?</p><br /><p>Consider how recently European art broke free from dogmatic classicism and realism. And how many such works are still counted among the masterpieces. I think it's a bit problematic to be so definitive about subjective perspective.</p><br /><p>From the same piece:</p><br /><blockquote>The Mona Lisa has become the Mona Lisa because of the legendary stories that have accumulated around that rather “unremarkable” little portrait. <strong>The Mona Lisa cannot be assessed as a painting anymore. It is inextricably linked to value</strong>, by the international idolisation of Leonardo Da Vinci to the status of a demigod, by Napoleon’s secretion of the painting into his bedroom, by the infamous thefts which transformed her into an icon of France, by its successful concealment through the resistance from the Nazis during the Second World War, by its transatlantic journey from Paris to New York in an hermetically sealed box...</blockquote><p>I don't think I've ever had a conversation about the Mona Lisa that touched on its artistic qualities. Or even the feeling it conjures. Rather, it seems like a binary. An event. A necessary pilgrimage. Have you seen it or not? Rather than whether you love it and why. The painting has taken on so much more than the conscious of its creator. The brushstrokes themselves almost irrelevant. </p><br /><p>I'm also reminded of seeing Starry Night a few years ago in MoMA. The room was absolutely packed. People lined up to take selfies with an image they'd seen plastered on bags and postcards. But how many know Vincent van Gogh painted it while in an asylum? That he painted it in between breakdowns, through the bars in the window?</p><br /><p>Is it the wonderful exaggerations, the possible product of visions, that we are grasping at? Is it the galaxy or the cypress trees? Or is it all the context that has built up in the intervening years?</p><br /><p>Vincent van Gogh seems to be particularly suited to a world where textual analysis rules. The hundreds of surviving <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/diving-into-van-goghs-letters/\">letters</a> between the van Gogh brothers and others are a peerless treasure for those wishing to grasp the consciousness of the creator. But how many have read them? I didn't. I haven't.</p><br /><p>This all may seem academic, but it would necessarily shape the kind of art being produced even now. Some artists, famously, evolve significantly throughout their careers, picking up new styles and mediums. But if the value of art is something outside the artists then many are likely to be trapped by expectation. Their work only valued if they embrace the context that has surrounded their work.</p><br /><p><em>(My emphasis)</em></p><br />",

I'm now far less taken by the \"genius\" of Vincent. Rather, I'm enamoured with his brother.</p><br /><p>The book is a brilliant illustration of the importance of family. Vincent appears to have been a loner, but defies the lone genius trope.</p><br /><blockquote>Theo knew better than anyone the trials of living with his brother: the insecurity and defensiveness, the alternating currents of guileless optimism and abyssal depression, the inner war of grand ambition and easy frustration.</blockquote><p>The family were prolific letter writers, and so the story is largely constructed around surviving correspondence. Mainly that between the brothers, but also of their family and contemporaries. Looking through my notes, however, much of it is taken with harangues, tantrums, feuds and demands.</p><br /><blockquote>He wrote Theo, too, unapologetically detailing his new life (“I have a real studio of my own, and I am so glad”) and hinting darkly that he might be forced to borrow again from Mauve if Theo did not replenish his empty pockets—or even go to Tersteeg for money. Fearing another family embarrassment, Theo sent the money, but not without blistering his brother for behaving so badly toward their parents. “What the devil made you so childish and so shameless?” he scolded. “One day you will be extremely sorry for having been so callous in this matter.” Vincent exploded at the rebuke, responding to his brother’s accusations in a long and furious rebuttal. “I offer no apology,” he declared. To Theo’s charge that such bickering threatened their aging father’s health, Vincent replied acidly: “The murderer has left the house.” Instead of softening his demands, he complained that Theo had not sent enough money, and insisted that Theo guarantee further payments because “I must know with some certainty what to expect.”</blockquote><p>The book charts Vincent's slow spiral, from an upper middle class upbringing, through repeated failures in numerous fields. Vincent appears to have lived with mental illness most of his life, and only really started to gain fame after his suicide.</p><br /><p>Along the way Vincent seemed to alienate almost everybody, including his parents, uncles, bosses, co-workers, landlords, art suppliers, fellow students, siblings, and entire towns and villages.</p><br /><p>But not his brother. Theo supported him throughout, financially and emotionally. For most of his time as an artist Theo paid his bills. He offered encouragement and advice, and acted as a go-between to important contacts or people Vincent had already antagonised.</p><br /><p>For someone who dreamed of family and a place in the world, Theo was it.</p><br /><p>That any of us know of Vincent van Gogh is due to Theo and his wife, Johanna. Theo even saved his paintings and letters, stashing them in drawers and under his bed. But he died shortly after Vincent. It was Johanna who organised exhibitions of, and curated, Vincent's work. Johanna was even the first to publish the brothers' correspondence.</p><br /><p>Vincent was a genius but he didn't do it alone. It took a village.</p><br />",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Moderating on Facebook sounds like a nightmare. Casey Newton <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">had an explosive story</a> last year of panic attacks and high turnover. But the problem isn&#8217;t just for the moderators themselves, but in aggregate. As a philosophical problem.</p><br />\n<p>Moderation sets the bounds on reality and acceptableness for billions of people. Across cultures and contexts. Across time. Will a private organisation ever be equipped for this? Could anything, really?</p><br />\n<p>I was thinking about this as I finished up Steven Levy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/facebook-the-inside-story/oclc/1124779180\">new book on Facebook</a>. It&#8217;s a sweeping account of Facebook&#8217;s rise and recent bout with internal territorialism. But there were really interesting digressions on moderating content at scale.</p><br />\n<p>Levy describes intense debates over what is and isn&#8217;t <em>kosher</em>. I use the word deliberately as the image of ever expanding notes and commentary strikes as a quasi religious one. A guide that is first quite narrow and absolute but must be argued over, reinterpreted and contextualised to new situations. <em>Interpreted</em>. At scale.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>The rules can venture into confounding, Jesuitical flights of logic. Some things are fairly straightforward. There are attempts to define levels of offensiveness in subjects like exposure to human viscera. Some exposure is okay. Other varieties require an “interstitial,” a warning on the screen like the one before a television show that might show a glimpse of buttocks. Outright gore is banned. It takes a judgment call to fit a given bloodbath into the right box. “If you rewind to Facebook’s early, early days, I don’t think many people would have realized that <strong>we’d have entire teams debating the nuances of how we define what is nudity, or what exactly is graphic violence,</strong>” says Guy Rosen of the Integrity team&#8230; Facebook has created a vast number of non-public supplementary documents that drill on specific examples. These are the Talmudic commentaries shedding light on Facebook’s Torah, the official Community Standards. A New York Times reporter said he had collected <strong>1,400 pages of these interpretations</strong>&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an abstract problem, sure, Facebook needs to crackdown on abuse and misinformation etc. etc. But in practice they are dealing with oceans of grey.</p><br />\n<p>And there is no <em>average</em> set of values. Give my grandma and me the same stack of posts and we&#8217;d whittle them down to different subsets.</p><br />\n<p>This is why the word <em>interpret</em> is important. Not just of the rules but the posts themselves. And layered on top of all this is that it apparently takes place at such speed as to make the nuances moot.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Facebook expects moderators to make about 400 “jumps” a day, which means an <strong>“average handle time” of around 40 seconds</strong> for them to determine whether a questionable video or post must remain, be taken down, or in rare cases, escalated to a manager, who might send the most baffling decision to the policy-crats at Menlo Park. Facebook says that there is no set time limit on each decision, but reporting by journalists and several academics who have done deep dives on the process all indicate that <strong>pondering existential questions on each piece of content would put one’s low-paying moderation career at risk</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The scale and speed, maybe more than anything else, is what concerns me. At least for now it doesn&#8217;t seem like a technological solution is in the offing. The incentive of those tasked with interpreting marginal content is to be restrictive. Better over than underdo it. And recourse is opaque and minimal.</p><br />\n<p>Even given good will among everyone involved, top to bottom, this isn&#8217;t a great recipe. This isn&#8217;t how we should be determining reality for billions of people.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

A state that must be protected. Something distinct from humans.</p><br />\n<p>It&#8217;s especially jarring in discussions of nutrition and health. The absence of chemicals is ipso facto better for you. The diets of generations past something sacrosanct.</p><br />\n<p>But it&#8217;s often an arbitrary distinction.</p><br />\n<p>These orange carrots may not have been sprayed or grown with chemicals, but they&#8217;ve been altered by generations of farming. This slice of land may not have any obvious human alterations, no buildings or roads. But our presence in and around it has changed it. We&#8217;ve thinned it with our steps and diets. We&#8217;ve changed the climate, macro and micro.</p><br />\n<p>Our perceptions of nature are almost always skin deep. Our recognised impact only the most brutal. I&#8217;m halfway through <a href=\"https://www.quarterlyessay.com.au/essay/2020/03/cry-me-a-river\">a Quarterly Essay</a> on the Murray-Darling Basin, where much of Australia&#8217;s agriculture is located and water politics is fierce.</p><br />\n<p>But right now I&#8217;m gripped by a contested state of nature:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>These stories of the river are increasingly contested, as the engineers attempt to model and restore some portion of “natural” flows. The irrigators on the Lachlan, in their interviews with me, posed the question of what the Water Holder thought the “natural” state of the Cumbung Swamp would have been, and what “sustainable” might look like. <strong>What is natural? What people remember from their childhood, what the traditional owners have recorded in stories, or what the water engineers’ models tell us would once have happened before we built dams and locks and weirs and drew away so much of the water for our own use?</strong> And how to account for climate change?</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>The natural state lies outside living memory, in the realm of dreaming and anecdote. In both the real and the political landscape of the Murray–Darling Basin, <strong>nature is often referred to, used as a justification for action, but increasingly it is out of reach</strong>, a concept rather than a reality.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Put aside that natural appears to be conflated with &#8220;healthy&#8221;. It&#8217;s temporal.</p><br />\n<p>The question seems to be about the baseline. At what point was the river system &#8220;natural&#8221;? And, if we pick a time when humans were present, why is it any more natural than it is now?</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

NBA commentators will often remark on how necessary it is for shooters. That they took the next shot as if they forgot the last one.</p><br />\n<p>But Menon, Bryant, shows it can go too far. It can blind you to others.</p><br />\n<p>This summer I read a great book about the process of basketball: <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-a-beautiful-game-the-thinking-fans-tour-of-the-nba/oclc/892937114&#038;referer=brief_results\">the art of a beautiful game</a> by Chris Ballard. The Kobe chapters are, somewhat predictably, about his legendary competitiveness. Note how early it starts.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>He keeps bugging Brian Shaw, then a star player in Europe, to play him one-on-one. Eventually Shaw relents, and the two play H-O-R-S-E. “To this day, Kobe claims he beat me,” says Shaw. “I’m like, right, an <strong>11-year-old kid</strong>, but he’s serious.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Now Kobe is <strong>13 years old</strong> and an eighth-grader in the suburbs of Philadelphia, skinny as a paper clip. He is scrimmaging against varsity players at Lower Merion High in an informal practice. They are taken aback. “Here’s this kid, and he has no fear of us at all,” says Doug Young, then a sophomore on the team. “He’s throwing elbows, setting hard screens.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bryant, now 17</strong>, is to play one-on-one against Michael Cooper, the former Lakers guard and one of the premier defenders in NBA history. Cooper is 40 years old but still in great shape, wiry and long and much stronger than the teenage Bryant. The game is not even close. <strong>“It was like Cooper was mesmerized by him,”</strong> says Ridder, now the Warriors’ director of media relations. After 10 minutes, West stands up. “That’s it, I’ve seen enough,” he says. “He’s better than anyone we’ve got on the team right now. Let’s go.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The examples are endless. Bryant’s belief in his own powers started young and apparently drove him to greatness. It was plain every time he took the court. You could see it in his eyes.</p><br />\n<p>But Ballard also reveals the flip side. Of Bryant basically tormenting teammates through an obsession with winning. How, as Menon noted, his <em>self-obsession often came at others’ expense</em>.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Now it’s 2000, and Bryant is an All-Star and a franchise player. Still, when guard Isaiah Rider is signed as a free agent by the Lakers, Bryant forces Rider to repeatedly play one-on-one after practice to house-break this newest potential alpha male. (Bryant wins, of course.) When Mitch Richmond arrives the next year, it’s the same. “He was the man, and he wanted us to know it,” says Richmond. “He was never mean or personal about it; it’s just how he was.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is probably what I will take away from Bryant. He was a joy to watch compete. Not just gifted but amazingly driven to be the best. But there was also a nasty side to that. What drove him to greatness likely drove him too far.</p><br />\n<p>He was blinded by belief.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

In some respects this is correct, especially for countries without access to a lot of low-emissions power.</p><br />\n<p>But reading <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/superpower-australias-low-carbon-opportunity/oclc/1101274497&#038;referer=brief_results\">Superpower</a> by Ross Garnaut makes me realise that there is a huge opportunity. Especially for countries with access to large quantities of wind, solar, hydro and tidal power.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Australia’s resource base placed it well for the energy transition: it had a <strong>wide range of high-quality renewable energy resources and economically favourable opportunities for geosequestration of emissions from traditional coal and gas generation</strong>&#8230; Australia’s hydro-electric resources and potential for pumped hydro-electric storage (PHS) in the Snowy Mountains and Tasmania, and perhaps its proximity to the immense hydro-electricity resources on the island of New Guinea, would play big roles in balancing solar and wind&#8230;.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s already a company <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/20b-plan-to-supply-solar-power-from-australia-to-spore\">raising funds</a> to supply a fifth of Singapore’s energy via an undersea cable from a solar farm in Australia.</p><br />\n<p>But Garnaut goes further, pointing out that the more other countries put a price on carbon, the greater advantage there is for a country with Australia’s capacity to generate low-emissions electricity.</p><br />\n<p>A price on embedded carbon would make imports from polluting industries and countries more expensive.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Australia is the largest exporter in the world of mineral ores requiring energy-intensive processing for conversion into metals. <strong>Australia in the post-carbon world could become the locus of energy-intensive processing of minerals for use in countries with inferior renewable energy resource endowments</strong>. Second, there are opportunities for export of hydrogen produced by electrolysis from renewable energy, through liquefaction or through ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. The natural markets are the renewable-energy-resource-poor countries of Asia, notably Japan and Korea.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tackling climate change could move Australia up the industrial stack. It could rejuvenate manufacturing, countering some of the advantages of automation, geography and low cost labour. It should even benefit regional areas, as manufacturing is located near power generation.</p><br />\n<p>But, most importantly, this isn’t just an argument for investment in renewable energy. Countries like Australia have a clear incentive to encourage everyone to cap, price and reduce emissions, to invest in moonshot technologies.</p><br />\n<p>The more action on climate change the more competitive we become.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Generally a jazz standard has a set of chords that change over the course of a piece. The task of the trumpeter is to trace a line that fits the chords as they change. But your choice also has to make sense from note to note, <strong>so playing jazz is really like tracing a line through a two-dimensional maze</strong>. The chords determine the permissible moves vertically, and what you’ve just played determines the moves horizontally. As jazz gets freer, the actual chord progressions become more fluid and you have to be sensitive to your pianist’s possible next move, which will again be determined by the chords played to date. A good improviser listens and knows where the pianist is likely to head next.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course this is by a mathematician and mathematics is <em>a</em> subject of the book. And this grab comes amid an exploration of music and algorithms. But the explicit mathematical digression in the midst of this musical romp sticks out.</p><br />\n<p>I think it&#8217;s because I do this all the time (I&#8217;m pretty sure we all do). Just like Du Sautoy pulls music through his mathematical lens (and vice versa), we are constantly filtering and analogising. It shapes our world.</p><br />\n<p>As a journalist I have a hard time ignoring the decisions made in stories. Wondering at other angles or how the medium itself (text, audio, video etc.) inherently limits choices.</p><br />\n<p>In that sense my experience has me constantly stuck in the role of participant. Viewing through a lens of construction rather than strict consumption. I consume stories as one of a number of options, as a version rather than a totality.</p><br />\n<p>Perhaps we all do this when consuming news. But I&#8217;ve made these exact decisions thousands of times. It&#8217;s hard not to envision the dirty carpet of the newsroom, the white walls above my desk, the mild panic as deadline approaches. To wonder how the availability of talent, the domain knowledge of the reporter, any number of other factors; pushed and pulled on what&#8217;s before me.</p><br />\n<p>Similarly with economics. After university I have comparative advantage and opportunity cost tattooed on my brain. I&#8217;m constantly searching for impacts at the margins. I reason under a cloud of ceteris paribus.</p><br />\n<p>Your training, what you do every day, equips you with easy heuristics. But it can slowly carve grooves in your thinking. You mustn&#8217;t let it control where you end up.</p><br />\n<p>The trick is to be aware of it, and, hopefully, leverage it as Du Sautoy has. For greater understanding. Not to be sucked into thinking this is all there is.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Still, it&#8217;s one of the best articulated explanations for wealth and inequality I&#8217;ve seen.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Fundamentally, capital is made from two ingredients: an asset, and the legal code. I use the term “asset” broadly to denote any object, claim, skill, or idea, regardless of its form. In their unadulterated appearance, these simple assets are just that: a piece of dirt, a building, a promise to receive payment at a future date, an idea for a new drug, or a string of digital code. <strong>With the right legal coding, any of these assets can be turned into capital and thereby increase its propensity to create wealth for its holder(s)</strong>&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives you the crux of the argument. That how assets are turned into capital, and so generate wealth and confer certain rights, is contrived. This may seem like a simplistic and obvious point, but we often take for granted what protections are afforded to certain assets, why some stakeholders are held over others, or the myriad frameworks and legal fictions we use to interact with them.</p><br />\n<p>Who decides this, and why, helps explain persistent and widening inequality in many societies.</p><br />\n<p>The idea that people aren&#8217;t all equal before the law isn&#8217;t a novel concept. Nor is the notion that the already wealthy and powerful have greater ability to influence this. But Pistor makes a more subtle point.</p><br />\n<p>She focuses on how private agents, through private law, have taken over this process. Lawyers, not legislators, conform assets to the law, and select and fashion the law to suit.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Law is the cloth from which capital is cut; it gives holders of capital assets the right to exclusive use and to the future returns on their assets; it allows capital to rule not by force, but by law. <strong>The cloth is woven of private law, of contracts, property rights, trust, corporate, and bankruptcy law, the modules of the code of capital</strong>. Capital owes its vibrancy and frequent transmutations (from land, to firms, to debt, to ideas, etc.) to the fact that private and not state actors code capital in law.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>In that sense the issue is less about access to legislators and more about access to smart and creative lawyers. Especially interesting is how Pistor frames this as an implicit subsidy to those able to play the game.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Subsidies and other “entitlements” are typically viewed with great suspicion, because they are regarded as distortive of markets and lead to inefficiencies, even corruption. Yet, <strong>the legal protections capital enjoys are arguably the mother of all subsidies</strong>. Without the code’s modules and the possibility to fashion them to one’s liking, neither capital nor capitalism would exist.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>What Pistor reveals is a deeper problem than is acknowledged by calls for higher taxes, different tax treatment, greater transfers, or pretty much anything else intended to decrease inequality. This is a structural issue, an invisible force behind much of our lives. It&#8217;s about who gets to set the rules behind closed doors.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Realizing the centrality and power of law for coding capital has important implications for understanding the political economy of capitalism. <strong>It shifts attention from class identity and class struggle to the question of who has access to and control over the legal code and its masters</strong>: the landed elites; the long-distance traders and merchant banks; the shareholders of corporations that own production facilities or simply hold assets behind a corporate veil; the banks who grant loans, issue credit cards, and student loans; and the non-bank financial intermediaries that issue complex financial assets, including asset-backed securities and derivatives&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;The law is a powerful tool for social ordering and, if used wisely, has the potential to serve a broad range of social objectives; yet&#8230; the law has been placed firmly in the service of capital.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

AI requires us to produce, and even process and mark up, the data used to train them:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;AIs are not actually the free-standing replacement for human labor they appear to be. <strong>They are trained with and learn from human data</strong>. Thus AI, just as much as fields or factories, <strong>offers a critical role for ordinary human labor—as suppliers of data</strong>, or what we will call data as labor. Failing to recognize data as labor could thus create what Lanier calls “fake unemployment,” where jobs dry up not because humans are not useful but because the valuable inputs they supply are treated as by-products of entertainment rather than as socially valued work.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This questions the fear that humans are bound to be obsoleted, or even completely displaced, by computers. But a couple of chapters in <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/creativity-code-art-and-innovation-in-the-age-of-ai/oclc/1111379643&#038;referer=brief_results\">The creativity code</a> by Marcus Du Sautoy makes me wonder how else humans and computers will work together.</p><br />\n<p>Chess players have been teaming up with computers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151201-the-cyborg-chess-players-that-cant-be-beaten\">for a while</a>. But the stories Du Sautoy tells of AlphaGo are something else. AlphaGo <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far\">was famously</a> the first computer program to beat a professional at the board game <a href=\"http://www.kiseido.com/three.htm\">Go</a>.</p><br />\n<p>Go is thousands of years old and was thought too complex for computers to master. But not only did AlphaGo win, many of its moves shocked its opponent, commentators and spectators. Some were downright bizarre, mocked, and even described as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609736/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/\">alien</a>&#8220;.</p><br />\n<p>AlphaGo had taught itself to play Go. And, as its moves were analysed, it has also taught the rest of us:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>AlphaGo had taught the world a new way to play an ancient game. <strong>Analysis since the match has resulted in new tactics</strong>. The fifth line is now played early on, as we have come to understand that it can have big implications for the endgame. AlphaGo has gone on to discover still more innovative strategies. DeepMind revealed at the beginning of 2017 that its latest iteration had played online anonymously against a range of top-ranking professionals&#8230;<strong>Those games are now regarded as a treasure trove of new ideas</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really like the &#8220;alien&#8221; description. Because while AlphaGo learned from databases of tens of thousands of Go games. It also played millions of games against itself. Where, through trial and error, it came up with iterations we hadn&#8217;t seen before.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>The trouble with modern Go is that conventions had built up about ways to play&#8230; But by breaking those conventions AlphaGo had cleared the fog and revealed an even higher peak&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because the humans had also been trained on a store of games past. By playing against itself, AlphaGo broke out of those ruts. And a version of the algorithm that wasn&#8217;t trained on past games at all became even more bizarre and unbeatable.</p><br />\n<p>Just think of the possibilities when taken out of the narrow problem of games.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>DeepMind now has an even better algorithm that can thrash the original version of AlphaGo. This algorithm circumvented the need to be shown how humans play the game&#8230; It was no longer constrained by the way humans think and play. Within three days of training, in which time it played 4.9 million games against itself, it was able to beat by 100 games to nil the version of AlphaGo that had defeated Lee Sedol. <strong>What took humans 3000 years to achieve, it did in three days</strong>. By day forty it was unbeatable.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em></em></p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

And I have been struck by this in a new foreward by Vitalik Buterin and Jaron Lanier:</p><br /><br />\n<blockquote><p>It is important to understand the proposed radical markets in the spirit in which they are offered. <strong>A mechanism cannot become the center of human civilization but must serve as a tool in the context of civilization</strong>. That point should be implicit, since many methods are proposed here; obviously, the intent is not to make any one of them singularly dominant.</p><br /><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the Radical Markets hype a year ago, it&#8217;s essentially an argument to inject market mechanisms, and our greater knowledge of how markets work, into more aspects of society. Such as by introducing <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting\">quadratic voting</a> in elections to better measure intensity in preferences.</p><br /><br />\n<p>Or, more spectacularly, perpetually auctioning the use rights of private property. Essentially, allowing anyone to go and bid on any property at any time. The idea being (among other things) to better capture the value of these assets in the tax system.</p><br /><br />\n<p>There are problems with some of these ideas. Initially at least. Such as that without initial capital reallocation, the removal of certain property rights could lead to more inequality. Or that many people desperately need the stability afforded them by property ownership.</p><br /><br />\n<p>But I really like this argument that we need to consider the idea within context rather than turning it into a straw man. We need to think of them as mechanisms that could be strategically employed, within an established political economy.</p><br /><br />\n<p>Especially as our discourse has sped up, as more diverse voices added, it is tempting to summarily dismiss new ideas because they aren&#8217;t perfect. Because there are negative consequences that hadn&#8217;t been considered.</p><br /><br />\n<p>I like Ryan Avent&#8217;s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ryanavent_93844/a-brief-ish-review-of-radical-markets-6454ba0637a8\">reading of Radical Markets</a> as a work of political philosophy. On the need to consider radical solutions to big problems. As an appeal to consider market mechanisms in areas that we currently don&#8217;t.</p><br /><br />\n<p>Again from Buterin and Jaron Lanier:</p><br /><br />\n<blockquote><p>Abstractions can play out differently according to context. <strong>Any mechanism can be turned into an instrument of violence if it is overly amplified and drowns out every other process in a society</strong>. And yet without better mechanisms, we are doomed to stumble around, failing to address the complexities of our times.</p><br /><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>None of the rules in society are natural. They&#8217;ve all been contrived. The questions are why and by whom. Injecting markets into more areas of society may make sense. Or maybe the inverse.</p><br /><br />\n<p>New ideas may not suit as panaceas, but do right in specific situations or after some adaptation. Perhaps it&#8217;s time for something more targeted.</p><br /><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br /><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Especially with such certainty. Even given sufficient training, tools and time.</p><br />\n<p>But as this passage in <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quaint-revolution/oclc/1126569133&#038;referer=brief_results\">The Man Who Solved the Market</a> highlights, it also likely breeds complacence among the retail investors in the audience.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>During his time helping to run the Medallion fund, Elwyn Berlekamp came to view the narratives that most investors latch on to to explain price moves as quaint, even dangerous, because they <strong>breed misplaced confidence that an investment can be adequately understood and its futures divined</strong>. If it was up to Berlekamp, stocks would have numbers attached to them, not names.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being so certain and deterministic tricks us into believing the market is <em>knowable</em>. After all, these journalists have brought the word from on high. They have revealed the market&#8217;s Rube Goldberg nature. Can I not learn these secrets too?</p><br />\n<p>But, similar to how we miss the tiny influences <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/everything-is-complicated/\">when we reason from personal experience</a>, these sweeping narratives of the market are dominated by a few big themes. They turn chaos into a simple story with characters and events, good and bad. They dismiss all the randomness, which is precisely where <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/facts-are-cold/\">consistently successful traders like Renaissance</a> stake their claim.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Another lesson of the Renaissance experience is that <strong>there are more factors and variables influencing financial markets and individual investments than most realize or can deduce.</strong> Investors tend to focus on the most basic forces, but there are dozens of factors, perhaps whole dimensions of them, that are missed. Renaissance is aware of <strong>more</strong> of the forces that matter, along with the overlooked mathematical relationships that affect stock prices and other investments, than most anyone else.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>That &#8220;more&#8221; in the last sentence is probably the key.

The internet has lowered the bar to information and expertise to almost nothing, but has devalued them as well.</p><br />\n<p>The utopia of <em>evidenced based policy</em> seems unlikely to arrive. Even putting aside vested interests. This is sort of related to <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/everything-is-complicated/\">my previous post</a> on how fond we are of reasoning through faulty analogy. But I wonder if it is not a more fundamental issue of the coldness of facts.</p><br />\n<p>This thought struck while reading <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quaint-revolution/oclc/1126569133&#038;referer=brief_results\">The Man Who Solved the Market</a> by Gregory Zuckerman. The book traces the story of Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies. They were some of the pioneers of quantitative trading and have had almost unparalleled success over decades.</p><br />\n<p>What separates Renaissance (at least initially) is that Jim and most of the others were mathematicians and computer scientists. Many didn&#8217;t have any experience, or even interest in, finance. Hence their goal was to create an automated trading system:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Humans are prone to fear, greed, and outright panic, all of which tend to sow volatility in financial markets. <strong>Machines could make markets more stable, if they elbow out individuals governed by biases and emotions</strong>. And computer-driven decision-making in other fields, such as the airline industry, has generally led to fewer mistakes.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But throughout the story you can feel a tug, between thus clear drive towards a fully automated system and a reticence to cede control. This was especially clear in times of turmoil and as the models became so complex and self-learning that it was all but impossible to understand why exactly a trade was being made (or reccomended).</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Then, something unexpected happened. The computerized system developed an unusual appetite for potatoes, shifting two-thirds of its cash into futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange that represented millions of pounds of Maine potatoes. One day, Simons got a call from unhappy regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: Monemetrics was close to cornering the global market for these potatoes, they said, with some alarm. Simons had to stifle a giggle. Yes, the regulators were grilling him, but they had to realize Simons hadn’t meant to accumulate so many potatoes; <strong>he couldn’t even understand why his computer system was buying so many of them</strong>. Surely, the CFTC would understand that.</p><br />\n<p>Soon, he and Baum had lost confidence in their system. They could see the Piggy Basket’s trades and were aware when it made and lost money, but Simons and Baum weren’t sure why the model was making its trading decisions. <strong>Maybe a computerized trading model wasn’t the way to go, after all, they decided</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s striking is that these were all people who understood the underlying logic of such a system. That while it&#8217;s (probably) impossible to predict any particular stock or commodity, there are patterns in the data. Patterns that represent biases, mistakes and other phenomena. That these can be identified. And, given enough &#8220;bets&#8221;, they only had to be correct 50.075% of the time to make an absolute killing.</p><br />\n<p>Most of them had been involved in the construction of the model. Many had previously done academic research, and even invented techniques, on which it was based. And yet they still had trouble trusting something they didn&#8217;t fully understand.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Some rank-and-file senior scientists were upset—not so much by the losses, but because Simons had interfered with the trading system and reduced positions. Some took the decision as a personal affront, a sign of ideological weakness and a lack of conviction in their labor. “You’re dead wrong,” a senior researcher emailed Simons. <strong>“You believe in the system, or you don’t,” another scientist said, with some disgust</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, they were also aware of the inverse &#8211; how fallible human traders are. And that many of their own mistakes, especially early on, were the result of human intervention.</p><br />\n<p>But it was obviously hard and contentious to move beyond this hill. To trust something they didn&#8217;t fully understand. The &#8220;facts&#8221; from nowhere. The truth without a good story. Maybe this is the problem with evidence based policy.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Or to dream up interventions to force them to do so. It almost always involves reasoning through analogy, which is something I&#8217;m very guilty of (just read basically anything on this blog).</p><br />\n<p>This kind of reasoning plays into a false notion that behaviour is the predictable outcome of certain inputs. And, as Watts points out, even if this is so, we&#8217;re terrible at recognising and weighting all the inputs in our own decisions, let alone everyone else.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Rationalizing human behavior, however, is precisely an exercise in simulating, in our mind’s eye, what it would be like to be the person whose behavior we are trying to understand. Only when we can imagine this simulated version of ourselves responding in the manner of the individual in question do we really feel that we have understood the behavior in question. <strong>So effortlessly can we perform this exercise of “understanding by simulation” that it rarely occurs to us to wonder how reliable it is&#8230;</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8230;our mental simulations have a tendency to ignore certain types of factors that turn out to be important.</strong> The reason is that when we think about how we think, we <strong>instinctively emphasize consciously accessible costs and benefits</strong> such as those associated with motivations, preferences, and beliefs—the kinds of factors that predominate in social scientists’ models of rationality.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Watts goes on to cite a laundry list of implicit factors that shape our decision making. From defaults to various kinds of priming and faulty memory and reasoning. These biases and gaps are now well known, but it&#8217;s interesting to think first about how little we understand about ourselves.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;although it may be true that I like ice cream as a general rule, how much I like it at a particular point in time might vary considerably, depending on the time of day, the weather, how hungry I am, and how good the ice cream is that I expect to get. My decision, moreover, doesn’t depend just on how much I like ice cream, or even just the relation between how much I like it versus how much it costs. It also depends on whether or not I know the location of the nearest ice cream shop, whether or not I have been there before, how much of a rush I’m in, who I’m with and what they want, whether or not I have to go to the bank to get money, where the nearest bank is, whether or not I just saw someone else eating an ice cream, or just heard a song that reminded me of a pleasurable time when I happened to be eating an ice cream, and so on. <strong>Even in the simplest situations, the list of factors that might turn out to be relevant can get very long very quickly.</strong> And with so many factors to worry about, even very similar situations may differ in subtle ways that turn out to be important. <strong>When trying to understand—or better yet predict—individual decisions, how are we to know which of these many factors are the ones to pay attention to, and which can be safely ignored?</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now imagine doing this over a population.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

The people tackling these problems are obviously far smarter and more experienced than me, but is that enough?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>All sorts of things could change and mess with an AI. As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, road closures or even hazards like wildfires might not deter an AI that sees only traffic from recommending what it thinks is an attractive route.

But it&#8217;s also likely that our wildest technological dreams will be achieved less by computers being &#8220;smarter&#8221; and more through narrowing the problem. Making the world safer.

And, honestly, it&#8217;s some of the best skewering of Artificial Intelligence I&#8217;ve come across. But amid the funny stories of AI incompetence &#8211; only recognising sheep when they&#8217;re in fields, thinking a goat in a tree is a giraffe etc. &#8211; there&#8217;s a serious point about the impact of these limitations.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>As more of our daily lives are governed by algorithms, the quirks of AI are beginning to have consequences far beyond the merely inconvenient. Recommendation algorithms embedded in YouTube point people toward ever more polarizing content, traveling in a few short clicks from mainstream news to videos by hate groups and conspiracy theorists&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;The algorithms that make decisions about parole, loans, and resume screening <strong>are not impartial but can be just as prejudiced as the humans they’re supposed to replace—sometimes even more so</strong>. AI-powered surveillance can’t be bribed, but it also can’t raise moral objections to anything it’s asked to do. It can also make mistakes when it’s misused—or even when it’s hacked. <strong>Researchers have discovered that something as seemingly insignificant as a small sticker can make an image recognition AI think a gun is a toaster, and a low-security fingerprint reader can be fooled more than 77 percent of the time with a single master fingerprint</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>People are generally quick to chalk up to malice what is better explained by incompetence. The righteous outrage in the papers is full of pinstriped fat cats rather than honest mistakes and fallible processes (sometimes rightly so, but probably not as often as portrayed).</p><br />\n<p>It seems our fears for the future fall into this same trap. What truly scares me about AI is generally the outcome of a perfectly running system. Skynet murderbots conquering the world. Or batallions of worker drones tilting the balance further in favour of capital and the technologically competent.</p><br />\n<p>But my recent studies of machine learning, and this book specifically, make we wonder whether the true worry shouldn&#8217;t be bias and incompetence. Not a murderous bot. Rather one that just isn&#8217;t ready for prime time. In that sense the problem isn&#8217;t the technology itself, but the underlying systems that deployed it (I didn&#8217;t explicitly write &#8220;capitalism&#8221; here, but I wouldn&#8217;t fault you for reading it in 😇).</p><br />\n<p>If there&#8217;s malice in the system, that&#8217;s where to find it.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>When people think of AI disaster, they think of AIs refusing orders, deciding that their best interests lie in killing all humans, or creating terminator bots. But <strong>all those disaster scenarios assume a level of critical thinking and a humanlike understanding of the world that AIs won’t be capable of for the foreseeable future</strong>. As leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng put it, worrying about an AI takeover is like worrying about overcrowding on Mars.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of Shane&#8217;s principles of &#8220;AI weirdness&#8221; is that it does not really understand the problem you want it to solve. Another is that it will take the path of least resistance to achieve what you tell it to.</p><br />\n<p>When you&#8217;re using AI to play a game this can lead to some obnoxious cheating. When you&#8217;re deploying it in the real world this can result in further entrenching bias, hierarchy and revealed preference. Often in ways we don&#8217;t understand and expect. Particularly if the implementors aren&#8217;t aware of the underlying bias in the system they are a part of.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>The problem with designing an AI to screen candidates for us: we aren’t really asking the AI to identify the best candidates. We’re asking it to identify the candidates that most resemble the ones our human hiring managers liked in the past. That might be okay if the human hiring managers made great decisions. But most US companies have a diversity problem, particularly among managers and particularly in the way that hiring managers evaluate resumes and interview candidates. All else being equal, resumes with white-male-sounding names are more likely to get interviews than those with female-and/ or minority-sounding names. 5 Even hiring managers who are female and/ or members of a minority themselves tend to unconsciously favor white male candidates. <strong>Plenty of bad and/ or outright harmful AI programs are designed by people who thought they were designing an AI to solve a problem but were unknowingly training it to do something entirely different</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em></em></p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

I had allowed lifestyle inflation to trap me in a situation where I had to earn a certain amount. I had fallen for the advertiser&#8217;s vision of freedom and empowerment through consumption, rather than a financial, emotional and mental freedom to work on things that have impact and bring me joy.</p><br />\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how I got there, as I used to break consumption down into its time value. Calculating how many hours in my minimum wage job equated to getting a couple of pizzas delivered, for instance.</p><br />\n<p>I seem to have stopped this at some point, but it&#8217;s a remarkably effective way of identifying what&#8217;s worth the trouble. I came across a very stark illustration today in <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-frugal-hedonism-a-guide-to-spending-less-while-enjoying-everything-more/oclc/1044562391&#038;referer=brief_results\">The Art of Frugal Hedonism</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>how fast does your car really go, on average? We’re not alluding merely to time stuck in traffic here. <strong>To truly calculate the ‘effective speed’ of our vehicles we need to include all the hours we put in at the office to cover fuel, registration and other running costs</strong>… with that speedometer sitting right on zero all the while. One Australian study calculates that for every hour spent driving a Toyota Landcruiser, the average owner spends another 1.5 hours working to pay for it. The study also points out that if the owner had to pay for their car’s ‘externalities’–those costs borne by society–of CO2 emissions, traffic congestion and the cost of road accidents, they’d need to work another 0.6 hours for every hour behind the wheel. <strong>That puts the effective speed of a Landcruiser at 9 kilometres (5.7 miles) per hour</strong>. Not so convenient after all, eh? A bicycle, by the way, with its far lower purchase, running, and externality costs, clocks in at a relatively speedy 18 kilometres (11 miles) per hour.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could probably run similar analyses on almost any gadget or service that supposedly saves you time or adds convenience.</p><br />\n<p>I, most of us probably, take our work lives as given. We <em>must</em> work full time. That gives us X dollars. Then we use those dollars as best we can to maximise the non-work hours.</p><br />\n<p>But what if you reversed this? Every minute you save by owning a car (could be anything) is one you pay for with one or more minutes at work. Could you do without the car and simultaneously reduce the work? How convenient is the gadget in terms of the hours required to pay for it, purchase it, maintain it and eventually replace it?</p><br />\n<p>What if you rethought both the numerator <em>and</em> the denominator?</p><br />\n<p><em>As usual my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

When called out over a questionable story the retreat mostly takes place to the &#8220;facts&#8221; within the story itself. Solace is found in the precise sourcing of a story, even if that <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/\">isn&#8217;t the way knowledge actually works</a>.</p><br />\n<p>Rarely are other dimensions questioned, such as whether the story&#8217;s very existence is misleading or lends undue credence or salience. Because that, also, is inaccurate. The five stories every day on petty crimes may be exact in recounting the details (as far as we can ever <em>know</em>), but is the presence of five stories an accurate portrayal of the magnitude of the problem?</p><br />\n<p>Is this conflating precision with accuracy?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;precision can mask inaccuracy by giving us a false sense of certainty, either inadvertently or quite deliberately.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/naked-statistics-stripping-the-dread-from-the-data/oclc/1088202284&#038;referer=brief_results\">Naked Statistics</a> by Charles Wheelan. I&#8217;m about halfway through and haven&#8217;t come across much that would be surprising to anyone who has done an intro statistics course. But Wheelan has an interesting way of theorising what are otherwise mundane concepts.</p><br />\n<p>Consider his framing of &#8220;precision&#8221; and &#8220;accuracy&#8221; (forgive the long quote):</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>These words are not interchangeable. Precision reflects the exactitude with which we can express something. In a description of the length of your commute, “41.6 miles” is more precise than “about 40 miles,” which is more precise than “a long f——ing way.” If you ask me how far it is to the nearest gas station, and I tell you that it’s 1.265 miles to the east, that’s a precise answer. Here is the problem: That answer may be entirely inaccurate if the gas station happens to be in the other direction. On the other hand, if I tell you, “Drive ten minutes or so until you see a hot dog stand. The gas station will be a couple hundred yards after that on the right. If you pass the Hooters, you’ve gone too far,” my answer is less precise than “1.265 miles to the east” but significantly better because I am sending you in the direction of the gas station. <strong>Accuracy is a measure of whether a figure is broadly consistent with the truth—hence the danger of confusing precision with accuracy. If an answer is accurate, then more precision is usually better. But no amount of precision can make up for inaccuracy</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bringing this back to journalism, it highlights the fallacy in retreating to details rather than the bigger picture. If a portrayal of the world is an accurate one then precision is laudable. But you can&#8217;t sacrifice one for the other. By no means conflate one with the other.</p><br />\n<p>If the audience walks away with all the details of the criminals but a misleading impression of the likelihood of their being a victim, that&#8217;s a failure. And it&#8217;s one we all eventually pay for through public policy.</p><br />\n<p>This is a rabbit hole I&#8217;ve wandered down many a time when thinking about journalism and the possibility of representing truth. Whether achievable or not, truth definitely isn&#8217;t entirely in the details.</p><br />\n<p><em>As usual my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and Stack Overflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. <strong>Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know</strong>, whether through a web search engine or another means.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Surely this goes for most things. Knowledge itself isn’t redundant, obviously. It’s experience, information and skills that inform how and where you search, and what for.</p><br />\n<p>But, at the same time, it feels like we’re still living with an outdated perception of intelligence. Intelligence as a kind of isolated store of information that can’t be updated or augmented mid-problem.</p><br />\n<p>I’m waiting to see a job ad that’s looking for a candidate that isn’t just qualified, but has skills to locate, store and retrieve appropriate information.

We are approaching thermodynamic or straight pneumatic limits with many of these things. This idea of dematerialization, decreasing the energy intensity — fine, you can keep doing it, but you cannot do it forever. If I built a house, I can make it lighter, but I will still need some steel, some lumber, some tiles, some glass. I cannot make it not using material. This is another kind of false god — dematerialization and decrease of energy efficiency. <strong>Energy efficiency is helpful, it’s happening all the time, but it has its own thermodynamic and material limits</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can we simply innovate our way past continued consumption growth and trust compounding efficiency to make up the difference?

But, for now, I haven’t been able to get over this section in a chapter on non-experts solving problems that bedevilled experts.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>“Shubin Dai, who lives in Changsha, China, was the top-ranked Kaggle solver in the world as of this writing, out of more than forty thousand contributors. His day job is leading a team that processes data for banks, but Kaggle competitions gave him an opportunity to dabble in machine learning. His favorite problems involve human health or nature conservation, like a competition in which he won $30,000 by wielding satellite imagery to distinguish human-caused from natural forest loss in the Amazon. Dai was asked, for a Kaggle blog post, how important domain expertise is for winning competitions. “To be frank, I don’t think we can benefit from domain expertise too much&#8230; <strong>It’s very hard to win a competition just by using [well-known] methods</strong>,” he replied. “We need more creative solutions.””</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is referring to <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\">Kaggle</a>, a site I haven’t yet found the bravery to crack with my new coding skills 😅</p><br />\n<p>Anyway, it comes amid an exploration of problem solving, and how experts can be trapped by their domain knowledge, falling back into familiar patterns that haven’t worked. Meanwhile the answer, as in the case of some of these kaggle competitions, ie often from somewhere else completely.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>““The people who win a Kaggle health competition have no medical training, no biology training, and they’re also often not real machine learning experts,” Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, told me. <strong>“Knowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things, but it also makes you blind to other things that you could do.””</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

He’s the “father of information theory”, without which much of the modern world wouldn’t be.</p><br />\n<p>Shannon reminds me of stories about Richard Feynman. Bursting with curiosity, yes, but also sparked with joy at tinkering with knowledge.</p><br />\n<p>I sometimes feel like this is lost in a world where education is sold as preparation for employment rather than rounding someone out or living a fulfilled life.</p><br />\n<p>On Shannon:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>“His was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play; he was that rare scientific genius who was <strong>just as content rigging up a juggling robot or a flamethrowing trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits</strong>. He worked with levity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the two. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself. And the marks of his playful mind—the mind that wondered how a box of electric switches could mimic a brain, and the mind that asked why no one ever decides to say “XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ”—are imprinted on all of his deepest insights”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here’s a little vignette from <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character/oclc/1022267511&#038;referer=brief_results\">Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr Feynman</a>, one of my favourite books:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>“&#8230;I laid out a lot of glass microscope slides, and got the ants to walk on them, back and forth, to some sugar I put on the windowsill. Then, by replacing an old slide with a new one, or by rearranging the slides, I could demonstrate that the ants had no sense of geometry: they couldn’t figure out where something was. If they went to the sugar one way, and there was a shorter way back, they would never figure out the short way. It was also pretty clear from rearranging the glass slides that the ants left some sort of trail&#8230;”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not only is this Feynman as a child luxuriating in experimentation and learning for its own sake, but also him repeating the story years later. Despite a dismal career as an myrmecologist, that’s how important and formative he thought experiences like this were.</p><br />\n<p>Putting aside personal fulfilment, I wonder how successful Feynman and Shannon would have been had they not “wasted” time building up other adjacent stores of knowledge.</p><br />\n<p>Especially considering how successful they were at bringing new perspectives and slants to established ideas.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Some things should have been left in the dust (notably gig-economy feudalism).</p><br />\n<p>But one thing it does offer is perspective</p><br />\n<p>I’ve just cracked open <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/invention-of-news-how-the-world-came-to-know-about-itself/oclc/915420218\">The Invention of News</a>, for instance, and have immediately been slapped with a couple of things that should be familiar.</p><br />\n<p>The first is that information networks in the pre-information age could only be sustainably maintained by the already rich and powerful. These were run either to ensure a supply of valuable information for private consumption, or the lower quality and somewhat biased stuff to influence others.</p><br />\n<p>Sound familiar?</p><br />\n<p>The next is that early newspapers existed in such an information rich environment, fighting against other practices and needs, that journalism and journalists themselves were not sustainable.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century <strong>only the rich and powerful could afford the cost of maintaining a network of couriers</strong>; as a result, those in positions of power largely determined what information should be shared with other citizens&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;this was not yet the age of the professional journalist. The information they provided was <strong>hardly ever valuable enough</strong> to command the exclusive service of one particular paper. Most sold their stories to whomever would have them. <strong>It is only with the great events at the end of the eighteenth century–the struggle for press freedom in England and the French and American revolutions–that newspapers found a strong editorial voice, and at that point a career in journalism became a real possibility</strong>. But it was always hazardous. As many of the celebrity politician writers of the French Revolution found, a career could be cut short (quite literally) by a turn in political fortunes. At least these men lived and died in a blaze of publicity. <strong>For others, the drones of the trade, snuffling up rumour for scraps, penury was a more mundane danger</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a journalist I feel both of these but am especially interested in how they relate. As the sheer volume of information has increased, and the value captured by new forms of distribution, the value has declined.</p><br />\n<p>Some information, obviously, is still valuable, but it is increasingly chased behind paywalls or funded for other reasons.</p><br />\n<p>And journalists, especially, are finding it tough. Jobs have disappeared and pay slowed. “Exclusivity” doesn’t really mean anything anymore, and so neither does paying.</p><br />\n<p>Will be interesting to see the trends that led away from this, as the industry matured. Can they be recaptured or substituted?</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

It’s few and far between, and much of what exists is caught up in prevention.</p><br />\n<p>Absolutely we need to reduce emissions and avoid 2 degrees. But we have also already locked in a certain amount of pain that will need to be managed.</p><br />\n<p>This is especially true in countries like Sri Lanka that have (relatively) negligible per person emissions and little scope for further reduction. Many of these areas will also bear the brunt, thanks to geography and economics etc.</p><br />\n<p>One example of it being done well is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/02/scotland-whisky-climate-crisis-heatwave-distilleries-halt-production\">The Guardian</a> reporting on a heatwave that shut down some Scottish distilleries for up to a month last year. The quotes towards the end suggest this is just the beginning of a shift.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Experts fear that last year’s conditions may not be unusual in future. This week the environment agency is hosting a “drought summit” in London with water company bosses, as fears grow over similar temperatures this summer. Research has shown that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/08/uk-heatwave-to-last-another-week-as-water-warnings-issued\">last summer’s heatwave </a> was <strong>made about 30 times more likely by the human-caused climate emergency</strong>. Some estimate that such heatwaves could be happening every other year by 2050 if emissions continue to increase&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>&#8230;Helen Gavin, who researches climate breakdown and drought at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said such extreme events place stress on the environment and the economy. “<strong>There’s an impact already</strong>,” she said. “It’s not just hot and dry summers, but strange weather like we’ve just had – 18C in February, that’s just weird. And that <strong>messes up biological and agricultural cycles</strong>.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t isolated. And, interestingly, some distilleries appear to have foreseen and planned for this. That can be replicated as long as the problem is made salient.</p><br />\n<p>Around the world we’re already seeing the impact of increased climate variability in droughts, floods, heatwaves etc. We have to start dealing with it, and that means drawing attention to the increased probability of weather events.</p><br />\n<p>It means highlighting what policy makers should do about city planning and building codes, helping people and businesses that are disproportionately affected, sorting out food and other supplies etc. etc.</p><br />\n<p>We have to stop treating the 2 degree limit as if it’s the finish line of a race that hasn’t started.</p><br />\n<p><em>As usually my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

They ruined it!</p><br />\n<p>They aren’t true Scotsmen.</p><br />\n<p>You can probably think of numerous examples. This is supposedly the driving force behind right wing populism around the world, for starters.</p><br />\n<p>There’s an interesting rumination on changing identity in a <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos\">recent Aeon article</a> on “hacker”. It sweeps through the evolution from curious kids playing with technology, through “cypherpunks” and “crypto-anarchists” to the modern, bro-y t-shirt and jeans Silicon Valley types.</p><br />\n<p>It really gets interesting towards the end, as the author places this change within the concept of gentrification. As more people take on an identity, some of the difference, the “disaffection” as he puts it, disappears.</p><br />\n<p>Technology was stereotypically the domain of “geeks”, who harnessed its power to build an identity, community and to express themselves.</p><br />\n<p>But an influx of people without those same predispositions has left it a rather muddled identity. More people have worn down the edges, making it child proof.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>At the frontiers of gentrification are entire <em>ways of being</em> – lifestyles, subcultures and outlooks that carry rebellious impulses. Rap culture is a case in point: from its ghetto roots, it has crossed over to become a safe ‘thing that white people like’. Gentrification is an enabler of <em>doublethink</em>, a means by which <strong>people in positions of relative power can, without contradiction, embrace practices that were formed in resistance to the very things they themselves represent</strong>&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>&#8230;We are currently witnessing the gentrification of hacker culture. The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, <strong>like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking</strong> over the subversive ones.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the POV of those who lament changing definitions, there seems to be diminishing returns to people taking on a group identity. The new people don’t have the same experiences as the founders. They have other identities that may be in conflict or demand different treatment.</p><br />\n<p>It reminds me of something I noticed in <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/coders-the-making-of-a-new-tribe-and-the-remaking-of-the-world/oclc/1076460563\">Coders</a> by Clive Thompson. He gives this pretty innocuous description of what makes a coder:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>More than introversion or logic, though, coding selects for people who can handle endless frustration. Because while computers may do whatever you tell them, you need to give them inhumanly precise instructions.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This fits within the framework of the Aeon article, of an identity shedding its roots as of outcasts and rationalists to one that is purely functionary.</p><br />\n<p>Just like national identities that shed ethnic and cultural roots, forming instead around civic ones. Flexible enough to embrace new people with other experiences and histories.</p><br />\n<p>Maybe there isn’t really anything specific in the various, changing national, regional or activity-based identities. It’s just the result of falling barriers and more people taking them on. As ever it was.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

But also cause things that are “obvious” so often prove false.</p><br />\n<p>Common sense just isn’t a great indicator of reality, especially when it comes to abstract subjects. The world, and especially what we should do about it, is often counterfactual. Something <em>feeling</em> right really isn’t indicative of a larger truth.</p><br />\n<p>For the past couple of months I’ve been running a <a href=\"https://github.com/joshnicholas/Send-email-with-random-pocket-articles\">script</a> that sends me five random articles every day from the bottom of my <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/\">pocket</a> queue.</p><br />\n<p>Lately I’ve gotten a lot from the 2016 US presidential election. “Donald Trump may not have a second act” said <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act\">one New Yorker headline</a>. “How Donald Trump Loses” said another from the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/opinion/campaign-stops/how-donald-trump-loses.html\">New York Times</a>.</p><br />\n<p>I don’t mean to call these out specifically.

We’ve all had a reckoning since Trump (and Brexit etc. etc.). But when you’re reading articles from two years ago, day after day, you realise the tone hasn’t actually changed that much.

But the exhortations to not strip history from both historians and ourselves, and so the context within which it has been understood and transmitted, are timeless.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>To begin with, do we really know what the past was, what actually happened, or is history &#8221; a fable&#8221; not quite &#8220;agreed upon&#8221;? <strong>Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete</strong>, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. &#8220;Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice”.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>I’d argue the same is true for the present. Our view of the world is inevitably shaped by what we find noticeable, what others do, and the context within which this happens.</p><br />\n<p>This could be dictated by the medium &#8211; stories related visually are inherently biased by the availability and power of the images. It could also be impacted by time, technology, ideology, culture and many other factors.</p><br />\n<p>But the spectacular reigns supreme. No one sets out to tell a boring anecdote in a bar.

Legions of authorities cloaked in total conviction tell us why we should invade country X, ban The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in schools, or eat stewed tomatoes; how much brain damage is necessary to justify a plea of diminished capacity; the precise moment when a sperm and an egg must be treated as a human being; and why the stock market will eventually revert to historical returns. A public change of mind is national news.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>This is the first paragraph from <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-being-certain-believing-you-are-right-even-when-youre-not/oclc/316509656&amp;referer=brief_results\">On Being Certain</a> by Robert A. Burton. I am just a couple of pages in, but this has stopped me short.</p><br />\n<p>The book is ostensibly about the biological origins of the <i>feeling</i> of knowing. How it is separate from “reason” and logic. But this paragraph perfectly encapsulates how the way society frames issues ignores and even rewards unwarranted certainty.</p><br />\n<p>Modern media has an endemic sense of certainty. Journalistic convention is based on an underlying assumption of causation, of the world in front of us as the direct result of something that can be tracked down and explained. Something happened so there must be someone to talk to, or a bang that preceded it.</p><br />\n<p>There’s no way it’s unknowable, or the result of complex interactions we can only tease out with time and after making many assumptions. Dogged by problems of measurement and perception. As a result you get a lot of declarative statements, black and white.</p><br />\n<p>When a professional athlete is doing well, for instance, we are furnished with stories of their extensive workouts. When they do poorly we hear about their troubled childhood and off-court issues. Or maybe they just suck now. There’s little room for underlying randomness, problematic measurements, statistical noise and mean reversion. A cause must be found and responsibility taken.</p><br />\n<p>The issue here is the need for a narrative. As a journalist, narrative is an important tool for grabbing someone’s attention, keeping it, and guiding them through a larger point. Or to highlight something specific and make it memorable.</p><br />\n<p>But what does a narrative need? In this context it almost always entails simplistic cause and effect.</p><br />\n<p>At the end of many news bulletins we get a financial update. We hear how this currency rose, a stockmarket over there fell, after hours trading is stagnant etc. All fair enough, except that they’re often immediately tied to a news hook.</p><br />\n<p>The Yen went down cause a Yeti was spotted in Turkey. The Nasdaq rose cause Dutch tulips were especially vibrant this year. Sunspots.</p><br />\n<p>Narrative is useful for audiences to connect with this kind of abstraction. But there’s no way causation for activities this complex were nailed down in the time between the signal and the news piece, if they ever can be.</p><br />\n<p>These triggers often are big enough to have some association, but how much? How that was figured out is honestly an even better story.</p><br />\n<p>That last line from Burton, about a change of mind being national news is also deserving of unpicking.</p><br />\n<p>It is fair enough that leaders changing their minds about something is news. But the problem is in how it is approached. How often is the story about the change itself rather than what underlay the previous “belief” and how that changed? How good is the information, or, if that hasn’t changed, the mental model that reinterpreted it?</p><br />\n<p>Beliefs often aren’t a binary proposition, especially when it comes to policy. Rather, they are about juggling trade offs, dogged by information asymmetries and stretched resources (mental and otherwise).</p><br />\n<p>But here I am also falling into the trap of beliefs as the function of logic and reason. As <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/\">I’ve documented here</a>, beliefs have many potential fathers. Perhaps biology is one.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

After independence and Sinhala made the country’s official language, <a href=\"http://www.ft.lk/columns/Sinhala-education-has-led-to-downfall-of-Sinhalese-and-country/4-660486\">education was converted</a> to “Swabasha”.</p><br />\n<p>But the elite kept English. It is the medium in most private and international schools. University courses are mostly in English, as are the offices of big corporations. There is a huge wage premium in an English education.</p><br />\n<p>All of which have resulted in an inevitable pushback.</p><br />\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/im-a-victim-of-sinhala-medium-education/amp/\">debate</a> over English education has been a backdrop to my last couple of months, as I’ve been learning to code and scraping the web.</p><br />\n<p>Just the other day I was scraping the Sri Lankan parliament website, and commenting to my grandpa how the HTML is all in English. But how can this be?</p><br />\n<p>This is the central point of a great <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coding-is-for-everyoneas-long-as-you-speak-english/\">Wired article</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>In theory, you can make a programming language out of any symbols. The computer doesn&#8217;t care. The computer is already running an invisible program (a compiler) to translate your IF orinto the 1s and 0s that it functions in, and it would function just as effectively if we used a potato emoji 🥔 to stand for IF and the obscure 15th century Cyrillic symbol multiocular O ꙮ to stand for. <strong>The fact that programming languages often resemble English words like body or if is a convenient accommodation for our puny human meatbrains</strong>, which are much better at remembering commands that look like words we already know.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>But only some of us already know the words of these commands: those of us who speak English. <strong>The &#8220;initial promise of the web&#8221; was only ever a promise to its English-speaking users</strong>, whether native English-speaking or with access to the kind of elite education that produces fluent second-language English speakers in non-English-dominant areas.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>There are a couple of multilingual programming languages, and programming languages based on other natural languages, but they’re nowhere near as supported or extended.</p><br />\n<p>Without a large community of fellow travellers there aren’t big archives of questions and answers to query when you yourself have a problem, or huge repositories of packages and modules to extend your code.</p><br />\n<p>I’ve recently been studying natural language processing, which is another domain with a huge bias towards English. The letters and symbols of many languages aren’t even supported by Unicode.</p><br />\n<p>The Wired article ends with a hopeful message that we might eventually have “Swahili HTML” and “Russian HTML” in addition to “English HTML” (rather than HTML being synonymous with English). The author notes that people learn coding better in their native tongues, and that European writing was once synonymous with Latin before branching into many vernaculars.</p><br />\n<p>But there needs to be a blend of these answers. There likely won’t be any one small natural language-based computer language that can compete with a large one for usability and flexibility. But that doesn’t mean localised computer languages can’t be powerful, useful or a great pathway.</p><br />\n<p>Until then a lot of the power of modern technologies will remain the privilege of those with English language skills.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Our thirst for certainty may also explain why a <strong>number of theories about crime have, when stated boldly, gained alarming and unjustified popularity</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>This quote from <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/criminal-the-truth-about-why-people-do-bad-things/oclc/976424912&amp;referer=brief_results\">Criminal</a> by Tom Gash falls right into the <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/there-probably-isnt-one-reason/\">recent theme</a> on this blog.</p><br />\n<p>I’ve just started this book, and I’m not entirely sold on its premise yet. But it does a good job of framing how public policy and discussion can be captured by a false dichotomy. And seemingly because the simple narratives fill a painful void &#8211; we don’t know why people commit crimes and it’s probably too complex to ever submit to an single, easily expressed answer.</p><br />\n<p>Gash essentially argues there are currently two dominant explanations for “why” someone commits a crime:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>The first I call the ‘Heroes and Villains’ view, because of its moral emphasis and its central premise that those who commit crime must be confronted by the full force of the justice system to avoid society becoming corrupted. The second I call the ‘Victims and Survivors’ view, reflecting the argument that crime is not simply a selfish choice but often one forced by adverse circumstances&#8230;</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>This dichotomy between evildoers and victims of circumstance is quite evident in the world around us. Take the war on drugs and it’s more recent backlash, which has so often been a proxy for deterrence.</p><br />\n<p>I’ve myself strongly argued against deterrence, leaning heavily into arguments about social context, learned norms and identities, and, ultimately, path dependence.</p><br />\n<p>But this is really too simple.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Think of the last time you committed a crime (contrary to our Heroes and Villains view, most of us have) – or, if you are in the minority, think of a recent case you know of. Then consider the forces at work affecting your behaviour. I am certain that you will most likely <b>uncover layer upon layer of possible influences</b>, many considerations interacting in complex ways to facilitate the crime in question.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>As Gash notes, “motivation” is too blunt a tool for what we are trying to accomplish. In fact, crime appears to be highly specific and contextual, and we’re ignoring profound economic, social and technological shifts.</p><br />\n<p>There probably is neither one reason or one answer.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

It&#8217;s one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in a while, and ties together <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/gender-inequality-and-linguistic-determinism/\">much</a> of my <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/\">reading</a> and <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/\">thinking</a> over the past <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/primed-for-determinism/\">year or so</a>.</p><br />\n<p>As a recovering determinist, I relish the celebration of uncertainty and the unknown. I&#8217;ve written quite a bit as I&#8217;ve read along. But here&#8217;s one more thought &#8211; the implications of uncertainty for silver bullets.</p><br />\n<p>As much as we try to make the world bend to our will, there likely isn&#8217;t just one reason for anything. And so there probably isn&#8217;t one solution for it either.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;The biggest things are unusual by definition. Unusual things often result from an <strong>alignment or interaction of many circumstances</strong> – that’s why they turn out big. <strong>By their nature, these will be harder to understand</strong>. However, this does not mean we have failed to research them as well as reasonably possible: in a world of enigmatic influences, research rigour does not equal nailing down. <strong>The best answer might be that there is no answer</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>The bigger the thing you&#8217;re trying to tackle or explain, the more influences it will likely have. Including ones you can&#8217;t see or measure. If you remove any of these jenga blocks, will your notion stand up?</p><br />\n<p>This makes transplanting explanations or &#8220;solutions&#8221; from one context to another incredibly problematic. Your idea may have &#8220;fixed&#8221; the problem over there &#8211; and that&#8217;s a big if. But do you really know why? What about all the factors underlying that?</p><br />\n<p>History is littered with simple solutions to complex problems and we&#8217;re all prone to creating panaceas. Modern democracies, especially, incentivise simple explanations rather than waiting, seeing and experimentation.</p><br />\n<p>But the world defies being put in a box.</p><br />\n<p>This is why public policies so often miss or fail entirely. Complex problems have complex causes and likely require nuanced and adaptable solutions. That it&#8217;s worked before or fits a particular world view isn&#8217;t enough.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;A favourite big thing, a silver bullet, has so many advantages: it’s easier to sell, to describe, to understand, to put into practice. But whether the thing we pick would travel, on its own, to another context is another question. <strong>Silver bullets seldom work once, never mind twice</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>As I have written previously, what this requires is a <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/\">little more humility</a>, as well as institutions and a culture that can accept uncertainty and not knowing. Working with best approximations and striving to improve them.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em>.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

And that much appears to be <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/why-are-we-not-keeping-up/\">stuck in formative states</a>.</p><br />\n<p>But twice this week I’ve come across arguments that our “beliefs” are actually so transitory and shallow that they are all but meaningless.</p><br />\n<p>That we are so riven with contradictions and so lacking a coherent world view that our “beliefs” are little more than fleeting notions backed up by post hoc rationing.</p><br />\n<p>First in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds\">an old New Yorker article</a> that makes me <a href=\"https://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/04/10/fact-checking-is.html\">seriously question</a> ever again trying to change someone’s mind.</p><br />\n<p>And now in my <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/singles-not-home-runs/\">continued</a> reading of <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results\">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>We asked our volunteers to choose their political priorities on a scale of 1 to 10. For example, what would you do if it came to a choice whether the country should spend more on state-provided healthcare, or spend less and cut taxes (where 1 was definitely spend more and 10 was definitely cut tax)?&#8230;A short while later, we went back to talk over with our volunteers what they’d written and why. But <strong>we cheated</strong>. We left their original answer sheet as it was–written in their own hand with their names at the top to help convince them nothing fishy was going on. But where their answers were anywhere from 3 to 7–so not a definite 1 or a definite, uncompromising 10–<strong>we flipped the question around</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>These are quite long quotes, but bear with me.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>The partially handwritten page in front of them was evidence of what they believed–or so they thought. And <strong>it was this (doctored) opinion that they now defended</strong>. I sat down with a man who originally said that tax cuts were more important than more spending on state healthcare–and listened as he now explained why the opposite was true. His explanation was earnest, intelligent, clear, without hesitation. He wasn’t confused. <strong>He accepted this new position as a legitimate summary of his beliefs and didn’t miss a beat in justifying them</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve read of studies where people surrender their opinion in the face of a majority or authority figure.</p><br />\n<p>But that we are so intellectually supplicant that an unrecorded belief is essentially meaningless has quite thrown me. And that we could be dictated to by a recorded belief &#8211; even a false one &#8211; even more so.</p><br />\n<p>To a certain extent this merely lines up with previous arguments in the book about complexity and simplification. But the lack of stability in the “lens” we use to understand the world &#8211; that I can’t feed you similar information over and over and expect a somewhat predictable response &#8211; has huge implications for discourse and institutions.</p><br />\n<p>Let me end with a concluding remark from this section of the book:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;the ideal of holding a complete picture in our heads damns our capabilities with an impossible aspiration. The world, quite simply, is too complicated, too big, too messy, to frame in one go. The fact that we observe it in often contradictory fragments is also a measure of the enormity of the perceptual ask.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Whereas India was a place with a rich history that embraced nothingness:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Indian philosophy embraced the concept of nothingness just as Indian math embraced the concept of zero. <strong>The conceptual leap that led to the invention of zero happened in a culture that accepted the void as the essence of the universe</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Author Alex Bellos goes on to assert that it is partly the transmission of these Indian concepts that spurred the scientific revolution.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>With the adoption of Arabic numbers, arithmetic joined geometry to become part of Western mathematics in earnest, having previously been more of a tool used by shopkeepers, and the new system helped open the door to the scientific revolution.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course the story is much more complicated.</p><br />\n<p>Not only did the use of Arabic numerals and arithmetic require a rich intellectual and practical tradition upon which to glom on to.

And weird <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliviataters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">performance art</a> (is it performance art when your code does the performing?) that people interact with.</p><br />\n<p>Looking at the source code, I&#8217;ve yet to find one that is more than a couple of hundred lines long, and most seem a lot shorter than that. Bots are often spoken about in catacylsmic ways, but also as an abstract idea that hasn&#8217;t really come.</p><br />\n<p>But here we have bots inserting themselves into, and augmenting, many peoples&#8217; daily life. Though simple, they provide joy, distraction, interaction and even community.</p><br />\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheQueenOfScots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mary Queen of Scots bot</a>. From an <a href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/retweeting-classics-literary-joke-twitter-accounts-75026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old article</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Besides fellow Catholic history nerds and scholars of the period, Queen Mary has attracted a fairly staggering audience among Scottish separatists, especially given the coming Independence Referendum in September. “Thanks to the astronomical rise of the Scottish National Party, anything against England or English policies usually garners massive support,” she says. “My Scottish Nationalist followers absolutely eat anything anti-English with a spoon. It&#8217;s a strange mixture of wonderful and frightening to see history take shape in that way.”</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p> <br />\nBut easily my favourite bot is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Every3Minutes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Every3Minutes</a>. It tweets every three minutes to remind us that a person was sold every three minutes in the American South between 1820 and 1860.</p><br />\n<p>Both a profound and devastating thing to be reminded of in a way that only machines can &#8211; regularly and persistently.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Apart from the odd shop and vending machine they are quite austere, functional and removed from the rest of life.</p><br />\n<p>You don&#8217;t really get the supermarkets, vast food courts or even accomodation that are often found in Asia or Europe. Public transport hubs are places to pass through, not go to.</p><br />\n<p>Australians are poorer for it.</p><br />\n<p>After reading <a href=\"https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/download/280/201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this paper</a> about Tokyo railways I can&#8217;t help but think this is partly because Australian transport is mostly a government activity.</p><br />\n<p>As government entities they are constrained in what they can do (lest they <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/lack-of-a-level-playing-field-media-companies-submit-to-abc-and-sbs-inquiry-531039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raise the ire of private competitors</a>). This not only reduces their possible services and the resulting community and consumer surplus, it leaves them open to cuts and &#8220;efficiency dividends&#8221;.</p><br />\n<p>The Tokyo railways on the other hand:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;remarkably for the twenty-ﬁrst century, the private railways in Tokyo Metropolis operate at a proﬁt&#8230;</p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Government regulation of fares coupled with limited subsidies for railway operations pushed the private railways to innovate and <strong>diversify into a wide variety of related businesses, most notably real estate</strong>. Due to their long-term interest in the communities they built along their rail lines, the private railways provide valuable social beneﬁts through public transportation while still pursuing proﬁts.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>Unlike Australian railways, the Tokyo railways are private and profit seeking. Coupled with heavy fare regulation, we have the happy accident of their expanding into other services and amenities as a way to maximise profit.</p><br />\n<p>It is arguably one of the reasons for the building density around the railway lines in Tokyo. This increases walkability and helps integrate transport networks, making it far easier to get around without a car.</p><br />\n<p>You now have a virtuous cycle even as the rest of us scramble to get people out of cars.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;private railways were able to survive and thrive by branching out into businesses closely connected with the railway industry, while private operators in Europe and North America slowly began to fail due to increased competition from the automobile&#8230;. On the Toyoko line, for example, Tokyu built high rise commercial centers at Shibuya station in Tokyo at one end and Sakuragicho station in Yokohama at the other, and opened its ﬁrst department store near Shibuya in 1934. <strong>The corporation oﬀered land at low rates to universities and schools in order for them to build campuses at intermediate stations along the way.</strong></p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Tokyu is one of the most proﬁtable railway operators in the country, with net proﬁts of ¥58.72 billion (US$587 million, €441 million) on operating revenues of ¥263.7 billion (US$2.63 billion, €1.98 billion) in 2006 (Tokyu Corporation 2007). <strong>Real estate and transportation each bring in an equal share (33.5%) of net proﬁt</strong>, with the rest coming from retail (20.2%) and other sources.</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, this could easily be an argument for complete government control. But I can&#8217;t imagine a purely government entity having the political might to get something like this done. Not without a whole lot else changing in society.</p><br />\n<p>And anyway, without the ability to grow around the railway as Tokyo has done, you&#8217;re unlikely to replicate the effect. This isn&#8217;t a plan for established cities.</p><br />\n<p>I guess this is more a call to be mindful of the extraordinary consumer benefit that can accrue if entrepreneurs are given the incentive to do so.</p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Surveys show that only one out of five children who receive help with studies from a family member get it from a parent. <strong>When parents are not the ones helping with studies, the oldest sister fulfils that role 70% of the time</strong>. Given the low education of parents, and the oldest sister’s role as a childcare provider and tutor, one might expect oldest sister’s schooling to meaningfully impact younger sibling learning and development.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from <a href=\"https://voxdev.org/topic/health-education/household-benefits-educated-older-sister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research into the benefits of educated older sisters in Pakistan</a>. Specifically in rural areas, where three quarters of mothers and two fifths of fathers were uneducated.</p><br />\n<p>Javaeria Qureshi from the University of Illinois found that having an educated older sister increased a primary-aged brother&#8217;s years of schooling, ability to read and write, and add and count.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>These oldest sisters’ schooling effects are the same order of magnitude as those for maternal schooling. Interestingly, increasing the oldest sister’s schooling has no impact on older brothers’ educational outcomes, indicating that the younger brothers are not benefitting merely from being around more educated family members or because their parents are increasing investments in all of their children’s education. Instead, the <strong>results suggest that younger brothers’ education improves because they have a more educated childcare provider, tutor and role</strong> model in their oldest sister.&nbsp;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an important finding not only due to the number of children not being educated in Pakistan, but the gendered nature of education in many countries.</p><br />\n<p>Women are often presumed to have a lower return on education due to a lesser propensity to work and support parents later etc. This can be especially important in resource constrained families even if there isn&#8217;t a prejudice against educating girls.</p><br />\n<p>But as is so common, there&#8217;s stuff we haven&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t measure, the world is complicated and factors interrelated.

The clockwork universe lay in shambles. Attempts to discover the laws of biology and sociology had failed. In the older sciences like physics and chemistry, the laws that Newton and Laplace had used were proving to be only rough approximations. <strong>Gradually, science began to work with a new paradigm, the statistical model of reality</strong>. By the end of the twentieth century, almost all of science had shifted to using statistical models&#8230; <strong>Popular culture has failed to keep up with this scientific revolution</strong>. Some vague ideas and expressions (like &#8220;correlation,&#8221; &#8220;odds,&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221;) have drifted into the popular vocabulary, and most people are aware of the uncertainties associated with some areas of science like medicine and economics, but few nonscientists have any understanding of the profound shift in philosophical view that has occurred</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely my experience that people are more comfortable with a deterministic model of the universe than a probabilistic one. But why are so many of us stuck in old paradigms even as our world has become immensely sophisticated and complicated?</p><br />\n<p>If nothing else, a more widespread probabilistic model would lead to more nuanced discussions around new research and challenges like climate change. A more modern understanding of mathematics would help us all get the most of technological advances.</p><br />\n<p>Many of the books I&#8217;ve read criticising modern education see it as a relic of the industrial revolution and empire, geared towards producing identical widgets to keep things running smoothly.

We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased perceptions of discrimination and that it <strong>reduces assimilation by casting religion and national identities as incompatible</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from a recent <a href=\"https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/abdelgadirfoukajan2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working paper</a> looking at a 2004 French law that banned &#8220;religious signs&#8221; in primary and secondary schools. It affected many religions, but was essentially a de facto ban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in school.</p><br />\n<p>These bans are purportedly to encourage assimilation and a homogenisation of values. But study authors Aala Abdelgadir and Vasiliki Fouka find that it can actually intensify a minority sense of identity.</p><br />\n<p>Which makes sense. I&#8217;m struggling to think of a ban on anything that actually changed minds. Some part of the population will follow the decree because they believe in it already. Others will stomach it. And the rest will contravene and reap the consequences/rewards.</p><br />\n<p>In cases like murder, the benefits of a ban outweigh the consequences for the individual. For <em>some</em> drugs, the tide seems to be shifting in the other direction.</p><br />\n<p>But do the benefits of forced cultural homogenisation really outweigh the consequences for these women and their families? Especially given they could rebound for generations?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>We measure educational and socioeconomic outcomes of French-born women with parents from Muslim-majority countries who were just old enough to have been at school when the law was enacted, and compare them to older cohorts who did not experience the ban, and to a variety of control groups, including non-Muslim immigrants and Muslim men.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Our ﬁrst ﬁnding is that <strong>exposure to the ban signiﬁcantly reduces the likelihood of completing secondary education</strong>. Part of this eﬀect appears to be driven by a negative impact on enrollment rates in secondary school for Muslim women aged 16 and above&#8230; We also ﬁnd that Muslim <strong>women aﬀected by the ban took longer to complete secondary education</strong>, conditional on their pre-existing age-educational proﬁles. These higher dropout rates and longer completion times indicate that the ban disrupted the educational progress of Muslim girls. This negative educational shock carries over to a <strong>number of longer term outcomes, such as labor force participation, employment rates, and fertility patterns</strong>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>These women and families were wearing scarves for a legitimate reason <em>to them</em>. That a top-down approach is destined to fail is driven home by the mechanism by which this all occurred:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>We show that these longer run eﬀects of the ban work through two hypothesized pathways: a discrimination channel, and an identity channel. First, women aﬀected by the ban <strong>report increased perceptions of discrimination at school and a lower trust in the French school system</strong>&#8230; Second.. Muslim women were forced to <strong>choose between a secular French identity and attachment to their religious practices</strong>, a conﬂict that often led to alienation from the French society. In the data, Muslim women aﬀected by the ban increase their identiﬁcation with the nationality of their father relatively more than their identiﬁcation with France.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Rather than facilitating the assimilation of immigrant children, the <strong>policy instigated a backlash, heightening the sense of cultural identity among the minority.</strong>..</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently it went further than this, with some states even banning the use of German over the telephone and some language that wouldn&#8217;t look too out of place in some contemporary discourse:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>A 1915 pamphlet of the American Defense League, one of the largest nationalist political groups of the time, reads as follows: “Any language which produces a people of ruthless conquistadores [sic] such as now exists in Germany, is not ﬁt to teach clean and pure American boys and girls.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the main thing is, the heightening of minority identity is similar, despite it being a completely different country and affected group:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>In line with the model, <strong>the backlash is greater in counties with a smaller share of German population.</strong> This is consistent with a cultural transmission mechanism in which parental and peer socialization are substitutes: In places where Germans constitute a smaller minority, parents try harder to shape each child’s sense of ethnicity because they cannot reasonably expect that children will be socialized in their ethnic culture through peer interaction alone&#8230; The extent of the backlash was higher also in counties with a greater share of Lutherans.. The implication is that <strong>communities with a greater initial sense of ethnic identity reacted more adversely to assimilation policies</strong>&#8230; The number of pupils enrolled in Sunday schools increased post-war in states that experienced a German language ban. No corresponding increase was observed in other activities of the church, such as number of schools or services held in German. This <strong>suggests that the backlash was driven by increased demand of parents for German enculturation</strong>, and not by increased supply of ethnic indoctrination by the church.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em></em></p><br />\n<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

This line of thinking holds that humans follow the rules of logic, calculate probabilities accurately, and make decisions about the world that are perfectly informed by all available information. Conversely, <strong>failures to make effective and well-informed decisions are often chalked up to failures of human reasoning</strong>—resulting, say, from psychological tics or cognitive biases&#8230; Models of social learning help us see that this picture of human learning and rationality is dangerously distorted. What we see in these models is that <strong>even perfectly rational—albeit simple—agents who learn from others in their social network can fail to form true beliefs about the world</strong>, even when more than adequate evidence is available.

It&#8217;s a site for people to ask questions of a large community of coders (I shan&#8217;t share what led me to browse the help centre of a help centre 😇).</p><br />\n<p>While much of the page is understandably specific to questions about coding, reading it gave me several thoughts for some universal guidance for good questions.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>•<strong>Pretend you&#8217;re talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence</strong>: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>•   If you&#8217;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last &#8211; sometimes <strong>writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>So often people come with a simple question or problem that they have buried in so much story/minutiae as to make it boring/unintelligible. But if you really want to find an answer, and quickly, it&#8217;s probably best to approach it like click bait.</p><br />\n<p>What are the details that will hook me into your question? Can you summarise as to confirm I even know the answer?</p><br />\n<p>The busy colleague is a good device. When I first started as a journalist my producer told me something similar &#8211; I should pitch ideas to him as if he was a stranger in a pub who would leave or find me boring if given a long preamble.</p><br />\n<p>Then:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. <strong>Explain how you encountered the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself</strong>. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible.</p><br />\n<p><strong>Help others reproduce the problem</strong></p><br />\n<p>Not all questions benefit from including code. But if your problem is with code you&#8217;ve written, you should include some. <strong>But don&#8217;t just copy in your entire program!</strong> Not only is this likely to get you in trouble if you&#8217;re posting your employer&#8217;s code, <strong>it likely includes a lot of irrelevant details that readers will need to ignore when trying to reproduce the problem</strong>. Here are some guidelines:</p><br />\n<p>•<strong>Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem</strong>. For help with this, read How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good questions contain context and are rarely just one question (more reason press conferences and panels are bad).</p><br />\n<p>When I&#8217;m really trying to pick someone&#8217;s brain or find an answer I often break questions down into their component parts. If it&#8217;s code we need to establish we&#8217;re all using the same version. This applies to basically everything.</p><br />\n<p>Questions can go awry when we&#8217;re each making assumptions about intentions, definitions, steps etc. So if you&#8217;re trying to find something out it&#8217;s often best to start small, at first principles.</p><br />\n<p>You can then walk through the problem with the person, just as the respondents on Stack will try and replicate problems. Sometimes you may discover you&#8217;re asking the wrong question. Are the assumptions baked into the question the real answer?</p><br />\n<p>Obviously this only works in a medium where you can go back and forth.</p><br />\n<p>Lastly there needs to be some amount of good faith. This is why I like anonymous questions delivered by a moderator at events, and why short interviews make little sense. Is the question a genuine attempt at knowledge or is it trying to convey something else?</p><br />\n<p><em>As usual my emphasis. </em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve been reading a series of technical and computing books recently, as I pick up my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a> studies. I naively stumbled into coding assuming all I needed were the terms and grammar of a knew &#8220;language&#8221;. But there&#8217;s so much more to learn for someone who has mostly had a liberal arts education.</p><br />\n<p>It&#8217;s a completely different mode of thinking. You often see coding/development described as &#8220;problem solving&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think that is quite acurate. I have been bumbling my way through a kind of alien logic.</p><br />\n<p>Actually, the best example comes from a recent problem I encountered on <a href=\"https://brilliant.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brilliant</a>:</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Define a comparison as an operation which takes in one number and tells you whether it is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, another. Suppose you are given a sorted array with 1000 elements, and you can use at most n comparisons to determine whether a certain number is in this array.&nbsp;<strong>What is the smallest value</strong> of n such that you will always be capable of making this determination, regardless of the values of the elements in the array?</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially what they are asking me to do is conjure up a number and find that same number in a&nbsp;<em>sorted</em> list of 1000 numbers. What&#8217;s the smallest number of comparisons I would need to make to find the match? I sat stumped for quite a while with this problem.</p><br />\n<p>Eventually I gave up. I couldn&#8217;t fathom how to even approach it. &nbsp;Having now seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the solution</a> I can&#8217;t imagine I would ever have arrived there through deduction alone. It wasn&#8217;t so much a lack of knowledge of terms etc., my regular heuristics simply don&#8217;t apply.</p><br />\n<p>Another example comes from a book called <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-software-works-the-magic-behind-encryption-cgi-search-engines-and-other-everyday-technologies/oclc/899229274&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Software Works</a>, which I am currently working my way through. This is from a chapter on protecting passwords:</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Authentication systems need a way to strengthen hashing without a performance-crushing number of hash iterations; that is, they need a method of storing passwords that requires an impractical time investment from attackers without creating an equally unrealistic time burden on legitimate access. That method is called salt&#8230; <strong>The salt is a string of characters, like a short, random password, that is combined with the user’s password before hashing.</strong> For example, user mrgutman chooses falcon as his password, and the system generates h38T2 as the salt&#8230;.</p><br />\n<p>The salt and password can be combined in various ways, but the simplest is <strong>appending the salt to the end of the password</strong>, resulting in falconh38T2 in this example. <strong>This combination is then hashed</strong>, and the hash code stored in the authentication table along with the username and the salt&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>If there are, say, 100,000 users in a stolen authentication table, and the salts are numerous enough that no salt is duplicated in the table, the attacker will need to create 100,000 tables. At this point, we can’t even call them precomputed tables <strong>because the attacker is creating them for each attack.</strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Buried in a section about scrambling (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not the right word I know</a>) passwords so that they cannot be reverse engineererd and easily matched, we have this interesting solution. Simply append a random string to the password before scrambling. Put this way it&#8217;s quite simple and I can follow the logic. But getting this far requires a kind of thinking to which I am unaccustomed.</p><br />\n<p>On the surface, that different fields have different approaches isn&#8217;t particularly profound. But it&#8217;s not often that we get to feel out of our depth on a &#8220;I don&#8217;t even understand how to logic this out&#8221; level. I am definitely feeling that right now.</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p><em>(As always, my emphasis)</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

A tree is not just a tree, it seems.</p><br />\n<p>Unfortunately, there is some controversy, and I am not capable of separating fact from anthropomorphic embellishment. Are trees really somewhat &#8220;conscious&#8221; (my word) of, and looking out for, their &#8220;children&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know.</p><br />\n<p>But given reasoning, Wohlleben&#8217;s firsthand experience, and the numerous studies he cites, there must be a grain of truth to the notion that plants are more than I had imagined. That my tendency to rip up leaves as I walk along is not a victimless crime. That the &#8220;pain&#8221; compounds through generations.</p><br />\n<p>Probably what struck me most were the descriptions of community, of interdependence. Passing on nutrients, creating shelter for one another. Partly because it requires the least blind belief &#8211; of course trees are better off together than alone. But also because it provides examples for the rest of us.</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>Scientists in the Harz mountains in Germany have discovered that this really is a case of interdependence, and most individual trees of the same species growing in the same stand are connected to each other through their root systems. <strong>It appears that nutrient exchange and helping neighbors in times of need is the rule</strong>, and this leads to the conclusion that forests are superorganisms with interconnections much like ant colonies.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to stretch this analogy too far, but of course this could describe us, with a few tweaks. That it doesn&#8217;t is a choice. Would trees be the same if given a choice?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>A tree is not a forest. <strong>On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem</strong> that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity. And in this protected environment, trees can live to be very old&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>&#8230;To get to this point, the community must remain intact no matter what. <strong>If every tree were looking out only for itself, then quite a few of them would never reach old age. Regular fatalities would result in many large gaps in the tree canopy, which would make it easier for storms to get inside the forest and uproot more trees.</strong> The heat of summer would reach the forest floor and dry it out. Every tree would suffer&#8230;</p><br />\n<p>&#8230;<strong>Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping aroundfor as long as possible</strong>. And that is why even sick individuals are supported and nourished until they recover.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

There appears to be a negative affect in homogeneous groups, but in mixed groups it produced a marked increase in &#8220;creativity&#8221;.</p><br />\n<p>What I appreciate about this research is the light touch.

I wasn&#8217;t a great, or really even that interested in being, a student until midway through university. But there&#8217;s also something a bit broken in how we approach maths. Both in school and life generally. </p><br />\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about maths as a purely abstract phenomena. A series of formulas and steps, divorced from how they relate to the real world. Where multiplication is a table to be memorised and trigonometry takes place purely within a textbook. </p><br />\n<p>This kind of mathematics not only strips away a lot of the beauty and joy, but relegates the subject to one only grasped by those who excel in a particular system. It turns maths into something like an ecclesiastical language, almost scary to the unindoctrinated. </p><br />\n<p>This is a shame, really, as Lara Alcock writes in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35628047-mathematics-rebooted\">Mathematics Rebooted</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;&#8230;mathematical thinking is not magical. It is often thought of that way in our culture, where it is common to have a demanding career or to run a happy and successful household, yet to say, ‘Oh, I am terrible at maths.’ I hear this a lot, and every time it is clear to me that <strong>it cannot really be true: this person is obviously a capable thinker</strong>. &#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>To some extent abstraction is necessary in schools as currently constituted. Students must be judged against something objective, and must be taught at scale. But does this really require so much concentration on the doctrine, to the detriment of the art? </p><br />\n<p>Why is maths largely rote, rather than logic? Abstract rather than practical?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Your mathematical knowledge might be rusty and full of holes, but people who can function well in our complicated world must be good general thinkers, and <strong>mathematics is just general thinking about abstract concepts</strong>.&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>When you read about the likes of Newton and Galileo, maths jumps out as a tool for problem solving and creativity. In <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301160.The_Triumph_of_Numbers?from_search=true\">The Triumph of Numbers</a>, I. Bernard Cohen explores how numbers and maths have evolved over time, and describes a plethora of interesting applications.</p><br />\n<p>Including the algebra of morality:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)\">Francis Hutcheson</a>] used this algebraic relationship to translate several commonsense notions about morality into mathematical language. The first is that if two people have the same natural ability to do good (A), the one who produces more public good (M) is more benevolent (B). Conversely, if two people produce the same amount of public good, the one with more ability is less benevolent (since it was in that person’s ability to do more). The plus/minus sign in the equation allowed Hutcheson to factor in self-interest.&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;&#8230;he concluded from his algebra that “in equal Numbers, the Virtue is as the Quantity of the Happiness, or natural Good.” That is, he taught that “Virtue is in a compound Ratio of the Quantity of Good, and Number of Enjoyers.” This led him to the important conclusion that “that Action is best, which accomplishes the greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers.” Here is a precursor, by more than 50 years, to Jeremy Bentham’s (1748–1832) utilitarian philosophy of “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.”\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>This is a maths of reasoning and personal application. He wasn&#8217;t trying to calculate the change from a $20 or the tensile strength of a beam. </p><br />\n<p>Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34757446-the-calculus-story?from_search=true\">The Calculus Story</a>, David Acheson produces probably the best explanation of how to calculate the area of a circle, by imagining a polygon with more and more sides (I think I finally understand pi r squared). </p><br />\n<p>As you might be able to tell, I&#8217;ve been reading a fair amount of maths books recently, and the thing that strikes me is how differently mathematicians approach the subject than how I was taught in school. </p><br />\n<p>Mathematicians work through subjects largely by reasoning and logic, not necessarily ever more complicated formulae. They also emphasise the problem solving nature of maths, often tasking you to think about a problem and come up with your own generally applicable rule.</p><br />\n<p>Putting this into practice, I have also been studying maths using <a href=\"https://brilliant.org/\">Brilliant.Org</a>, which has a similar <a href=\"https://brilliant.org/principles/\">philosophy</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;In school, people are often trained to apply formulas to rote problems. But this traditional approach prevents deeper understanding of concepts, reduces independent critical thinking, and cultivates few useful skills&#8230;<strong>The capacity to think critically separates the great from the good. We can grow this capacity by trying</strong> — and often failing — to solve diverse, concrete problems.&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>I have only finished one module on Brilliant and I&#8217;m not sure how it will work as a method for the masses. But I will report back in a couple of months. </p><br />\n<p>In the mean time, I&#8217;ll leave you with Lara Alcock again, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35628047-mathematics-rebooted\">whose book</a> I really recommend:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;School mathematics tends to come in horizontal slices: children learn basic ideas about several topics, then, the next year, they learn slightly more advanced ideas about those topics, and so on. This is entirely sensible. But it means that the vertical links are not very salient, which is important <strong>because mathematics can be seen as a highly interconnected network in which more sophisticated ideas build upon more basic ones</strong>. So this book’s approach is to focus explicitly on the vertical links. Each chapter starts with an idea that is bang in the middle of school mathematics—primary school mathematics in many cases—then takes a tour upward through related concepts, arriving eventually at ideas that people encounter in more advanced study&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

This is as true of knowledge as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/111013-the-arc-of-the-moral-universe-is-long-but-it\">anything else</a>.

While experts can identify pertinent questions and fields for investment, history is littered with examples of unexpected intellectual explosions.</p><br />\n<p>All of this came to mind as I read that the Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/31/academics-will-have-to-pass-national-interest-test-for-public-funding-coalition-says\">wants</a> recipients of research grants to prove that it “advance[s] the national interest”.</p><br />\n<p>Let’s overlook that the “national interest” and common sense are subjective, ever changing, and at least partially driven by intellectual progress.</p><br />\n<p>One such intellectual explosion is chronicled in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35388235\">The unfinished game</a>. Keith Devlin tells the story of a series of letters between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat as they try to solve what is essentially a problem for gamblers.</p><br />\n<p>Called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_points\">the problem of points</a> it posits a game where two players have equal chances of winning each round. For some reason the game is disrupted before anyone has won, and so the question is how to divide the pot fairly.</p><br />\n<p>Pascal and Fermat exchanged a series of letters on this problem. Although this process doesn&#8217;t pass muster as research by modern standards, would this question have passed the politicians&#8217; test? I doubt it. But the impact has been profound.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>“Within a few years of Pascal’s sending his letter, people no longer saw the future as completely unpredictable and beyond their control. They could compute the likelihoods of various things’ happening and plan their activities—and their lives—accordingly. In short, Pascal showed us how to manage risk. <strong>His letter created our modern view of the future.</strong>”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>From what else I&#8217;ve read, the author oversells the letters a little bit. But it was undoubtedly a precursor of modern probability theory. It was part of a movement that profoundly changed the world.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>“Even those who are not schooled in the mathematics of calculating odds know that the future is not a matter of blind fate. We can often judge what is likely to happen and plan accordingly. Yet <strong>before Pascal wrote his letter to Fermat, many learned people (including some leading mathematicians) believed that predicting the likelihood of future events was simply not possible</strong>.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>Without the ability to quantify risk, there would be no liquid capital markets</strong>, and global companies like Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, DuPont, Alcoa, Merck, Boeing, and McDonald’s might never have come into being.&#8221;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within a hundred years of Pascal’s letter, life-expectancy tables formed the basis for the sale of life annuities in England, and London was the [centre] of a flourishing marine insurance business, without which sea transportation would have remained a domain only for those who could afford to assume the enormous risks it entailed.&#8221;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of this isn’t to say that government&#8217;s can’t and shouldn&#8217;t roughly guide their research dollars. Some questions are more pressing or have more potential than others, which is why the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/if-youre-going-to-ridicule-research-do-your-homework-64238\">current Australian system</a> contains peer review.</p><br />\n<p>But that knowledge is a simple widget or knob to be turned up or down for national benefit is an ahistorical view of progress.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

This finding is consistent with hypotheses from the medical literature.&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Burgeoning medical literature provides reason to suspect that long-term exposure to elevated pollution levels may permanently impair older adults’ cognition, especially in the case of particulates smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter, commonly known as “fine particulate matter” or “PM2.5”. <strong>The small size of PM2.5 allows it to remain airborne for long periods, to penetrate buildings, to be inhaled easily, and to reach and accumulate within brain tissue</strong>. The accumulation of particulates in the brain can cause neuroinflammation, which is asso-ciated with symptoms of dementia&#8230;&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>So, emissions are not just harmful to the environment, but human health as well. The suffering isn&#8217;t only in the long term, evident only in a computer model, but in the health of real people living right now.</p><br />\n<p>It&#8217;s also worthwhile thinking about <strong>who</strong> bears the brunt of this. The workers in industries like mining, obviously. But as a recent hurricane in North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/22/i-saw-florence-sending-millions-gallons-animal-poop-flooding-across-north-carolina/\">showed</a>, polluting industries are also often situated in poorer areas:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors — and even without a hurricane — life expectancy in southeastern North Carolina communities near industrial meat growers is lower than in places without these hog operations. A recent study published in North Carolina Medical Journal found that <strong>residents near the industrial animal operations had higher rates of all-cause mortality, infant mortality, mortality from anemia, kidney disease, tuberculosis, and septicemia, and higher rates of emergency room visits than the residents in the control group</strong>.&#8221;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>As Ketan Joshi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1052699730382217221?s=20\">has noted</a>, denying climate science is now akin to being an anti-vaxxer both in the scientific illiteracy required as well as the harm being wrought. But we can&#8217;t expect to win this fight, especially in the short time we have to take action. Instead, we should change the subject. There are plenty of other arguments to make.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

No matter what you are doing.</p><br />\n<p>But the plethora of asynchronous communications methods &#8211; text messages, email, social media etc. &#8211; means the bar to phone calls is now higher. Or at least it should be.</p><br />\n<p>If it isn&#8217;t life or death, or you don&#8217;t need an answer five minutes ago, then don&#8217;t call me.

Can you provide a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any of the Conference of the Parties (under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in the last five years?

It is also predicated on passivity among those who consume it.</p><br />\n<p>Wikipedia, on the other hand, offers a model of truth as something we can all be engaged in, as something ongoing. It is by no means perfect &#8211; as nothing really is &#8211; but its potentially much better than what we are used to. And this is largely achieved through design, the tenets of which can be copied or extrapolated.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;From a contemporary perspective, though, the most significant design decision was that every page would have a public discussion page attached to it, which meant that there would be <strong>a record of all the arguments that had led to particular changes</strong>&#8230; Controversial changes made without any corresponding explanation on the discussion page could be reverted by others without having to rely on a judgment on the merits – instead, the absence of explanation for something non-self-explanatory could be reason enough to be sceptical of it&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;<strong>Reading Wikipedia discussion pages provides a way of understanding how a particular proposition or assertion came to be made and how it evolved over time.</strong> It’s like reading the transcript of an argument that has gone on for a long time – an attempt to track rationality in action. Like every other human-made thing, it’s imperfect. But in a polarised political climate, it shows what can be done to preserve us from the madness of hysterical, uncivil, conspiracist discourse that now characterises social media&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

As khalifa, Omar began a sorting process. In his presence, each written verse was checked against the memorized version kept by the professional reciters whom this society regarded as the most reliable keepers of information. <strong>Scribes then recorded the authorized copy of each verse before witnesses, and these verses were organized into one comprehensive collection.</strong></p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>As I read books like Destiny Disrupted (brilliant by the way) or pretty much anything by Karen Armstrong, I am struck by these differences. At the time of the founders these religions were truly alive, and followers and exogenous events were directly part of whole shebang.</p><br />\n<p>By contrast, the experience nowadays seems a lot more passive, of interpretation and extrapolation. Although there are some exceptions, such as some Christian denominations&#8217; belief in a personal relationship with god.</p><br />\n<p>But Mohammad was consulted by his followers and the revelations even shaped battle strategy. The community was not only driven, but provided direct feedback.</p><br />\n<p>Barring exceptions like the Ten Commandments, the narrative of the Bible also delivers a stream of guidance in reaction to outside stimuli.

Rather, you have to try to change the operation of the society for which the technology was created&#8230;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>You cannot warn about what a new technology will do to a society because that society has already made the shift.

The only way to stop the technology would be to reverse the changes in the society.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m not sure if Kurlanksy has me entirely convinced.

The authors found that less than a third of the premium paid for fair trade Ethiopian coffee makes its way to producers. Exporters grab a healthy slice, and the cost to comply with certification is great for both farmers and cooperatives.</p><br />\n<p>This is based on interviews with 1600 producers, cooperatives&#8217;s own records (numbering some 150,000 transactions), and data from the Ethiopian Ministry of Trade.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an average Ethiopian coffee farmer, who annually sells the equivalent of 400kg of red cherries, were to market all his or her red cherries as VSS certified, with current VSS premium transmission rates, the farmer’s annual income would increase by 6.7 USD compared to the non-certified cooperative farmer (assuming both types of farmers sell all coffee to the cooperative). Even in the case of a perfect transmission, the annual income of the average certified coffee farmer would only increase by 22USD compared to a non-certified cooperative farmer</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The paper also notes that certification poses significant barriers to entry. For instance, it requires detailed documentation in areas where many have not gone to school. Environmental and labor standards are admirable, but they also increase the costs for producers.</p><br />\n<p>Producers that are able to comply with all of this are likely those relatively better off in the first place. The paper notes that certified households are more likely to be located close to paved roads and coffee cooperatives, and have heads of households that are older and more likely to have gone to school.</p><br />\n<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, do these standards really achieve anything?</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;farmers in these settings often have diverse crop portfolios. They may be able to use sustainable production practices on their coffee plots but not on their other crops. Moreover, resources can be re-allocated within the farm from coffee to other crops, e.g., no child labor on coffee plots might mean more child labor on other plots. While coffee might have been sustainably produced and certified, it is possible that little might have changed in the aggregate at the farm, village, or country level.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, this is one study, and it&#8217;s an analysis of just one country and cash crop.

To put this into context, each individual win for a team like the Los Angeles Lakers, who gained about 214 million dollars in revenues this past year, brought in about 642,000 dollars.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>As only five players take the court at a time, one person can have a huge impact on winning.

Poverty gaps significantly narrow, suggesting not only those near the poverty line are being lifted up.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, as several <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmac/status/912612638089031681\">have pointed out on Twitter</a>, this is not an optimal method of development. Beyond the environmental damage you have negative impacts on health and a lack of incentive to invest in capital and human capital.</p><br />\n<p>However, there are peculiarities of the palm oil industry that break in its favour. Palm oil production has a greater positive impact on poverty than other crops. One of the reasons is that palm oil has to be processed within twenty four hours, leading to decentralised infrastructure.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The observed poverty reduction can be explained by more rapid increases in household expenditures for people in the bottom quintile and agriculture, and through greater provision of public goods most related to agricultural manufacturing, specifically roads and electricity.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indonesia’s over 1600 palm oil mills each buy fresh fruit bunches fromdozens of villages, often through a complex network of traders providing important aggregation and logistical functions for independent smallholders and farmer groups needing to get their fruit to the mill within 24 hours of harvesting. Urgent processing requirements mean the area feedingeach mill is roughly a 50 kilometer radius.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<p>All that being said (and I recommend reading the paper in full), there is one big takeaway. Roughly 90% of recent increases in production have come from expansion in land use, and the large number of small holders are significantly less efficient than the larger operators.</p><br />\n<p>Part of this is due to economies of scale that the smallholders can’t achieve. But with so many of our products containing palm oil, one way to tackle the environmental problem may be to invest in Indonesian smallholders to raise productivity.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yield maximizing practices relate to pest management, fertilizer application, pruning, and harvesting at the optimal time&#8230; The key on-farm technology is seed quality, determined at the planting stage&#8230; Roughly two laborers are needed for every five hectares of Indonesia’s current 7 million hectares of industrial plantations.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

This is true not just in practice, but also in the way it is taught.</p><br />\n<p>Look at any journalism course in Australia and you’ll find that subject knowledge is discounted in favour of presentation skills. Internships and practical media projects are favoured over electives in other academic disciplines &#8211; statistics, economics, medicine etc.</p><br />\n<p>This came to mind as I read the <a href=\"https://t.co/RieFIY6gXE?ssr=true\">last of Nate Silver’s essays</a> on the 2016 election.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent elections, the media has often overestimated the precision of polling, cherry-picked data and portrayed elections as sure things when that conclusion very much wasn’t supported by polls or other empirical evidence.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>By teaching journalists that their job is packaging the ideas and actions of others, the medium inevitably becomes constrained. What is good presentation exactly? Among other things it’s putting things as simply as possible.</p><br />\n<p>On the one hand this is a good thing &#8211; it makes the news widely accessible. On other other, simplification can itself be misleading. Condensing dozens of pages of a working paper, or decades of iterative academic theory, by necessity requires the subtraction of nuance. This is what Nate Silver identifies in his latest piece.</p><br />\n<p>Experts provided myriad caveats to their forecasts in the 2016 election. But constrained by their job as packagers, journalists provided only certainty. By banishing the details as boring or irrelevant, trying to get a clear angle, we were systematically misled.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>”While many things about the 2016 election were surprising, the fact that Trump narrowly won1 when polls had him narrowly trailing was an utterly routine and unremarkable occurrence. The outcome was well within the “cone of uncertainty,” so to speak.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But a narrowing of the role is only part of the problem. One of my friends is currently studying journalism and recently completed a course on data journalism. While this taught her a great deal on telling stories with data, she has little idea of what data to use or when, There were no economics, demographic, health etc. components of her course to provide her with the context surrounding the data.</p><br />\n<p>This narrowing of expertise by definition curtails what stories are told. A bunch of technical skills are being dumped on the market with little subject knowledge to act as guidance to what exactly is a story. It also means these journalists are at the mercy of the very experts they end up packaging.</p><br />\n<p>Now, of course, this whole argument is a great generalisation and misses many wonderful journalists. Especially older journalists who have spent time in the field and built up subject knowledge. But having spent much of the past decade around young and upcoming journalists, Silver’s analysis reads incredibly true. And it’s very worrying.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

The reason there is this split in social norms between crop and animal farming communities is apparently due to differing labor structures.</p><br />\n<p>18th and 19th century workers on crop farms were on short term contracts, often working as day labourers.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>In crop farming, the work load and the resulting demand for additional<br />\nlabor, is determined by the rhythm of the seasons&#8230; additional manpower is needed in the harvest season.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Workers on animal farms, meanwhile, had long term contracts.

Although often inscribed with  symbols to identify the measuring unit or to give other information about the transaction, the basic  data in the form of different  width notches, was understood by both the literate and the  illiterate. This feature invites  speculation that the use of the tally may have predated written communication.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The exact grain of the wood in each tally is different, meaning they are all but impossible to forge. The tally essentially achieved with nature something the blockchain does through an encrypted public ledger.</p><br />\n<p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6281.1975.tb00042.x/abstract\">According to Willard Stone</a>, the tally may go back as far as the ancient Greeks. Maybe even to 484BC.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Herodotus tells of a Greek from Miletus, because of the insecure conditions in Ionia, giving half his fortune to Glaucus, a Spartan known for his honesty, together with tallies&#8230; Many years had gone by when the sons of the man by whom the money was left came to Sparta, and had an interview with Glaucus, whereat they produced the tallies, and asked to have the money returned to them.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>From there the tally pops up all over the world and throughout history. Marco Polo described their use as IOUs in China. French monasteries used them to keep track of deposits. The British exchequer used tallies both to keep track of taxes paid, as well as what was lost during currency debasement.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Bank of England was  foundedin 1694, one of its first acts  was to make a loan of ~€1,200,000 to the Government. Acknowledgement of the debt was in the form of tallies,  the longest of which exceeds eight feet in length (these are still in existence and unredeemed).</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that the blockchain isn&#8217;t a spectacular achievement. It very much is. But we should recognise that a lot of today&#8217;s financial technologies aren&#8217;t solving unsolved problems. They are just more efficient ways of doing what we already do.</p><br />\n<p>We may be seeing an unprecedented technological boom. But most of our problems aren&#8217;t new and we&#8217;ve been using technology to solve them since year dot.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

It&#8217;s said that the inhabitants of Yap used gigantic round pieces of limestone as a form of currency.</p><br />\n<p>I&#8217;ve encountered this story in a few popular books and even a podcast, but the academic literature seems pretty thin. I&#8217;ve just started my research, but I can only find a few papers and books with more than a passing allusion to the stones.</p><br />\n<p>And many of the few references are to one book from 1910, called, funnily enough, the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/islandofstonemon009573mbp\">Island of Stone Money</a>. I&#8217;m not going to dwell too much on the book itself as it&#8217;s so full of orientalism the author thought nothing of beginning:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Like all other primitive people (it hurts one&#8217;s feelings to call them savages or even uncivilized, &#8211; one is too broad and the other too narrow) they are shy at first, either through mistrust or awe&#8230;&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the book is a good starting point to investigate the stones. It&#8217;s got an entire chapter on money and currency. And it&#8217;s all there &#8211; fei stones, sea shells, coconuts. Anything you&#8217;d want to trade on an island paradise.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;as far as mere existence is concerned in Uap, there is no use for money. But nature&#8217;s ready- made clothes, though useful, are not ornamental, and the soul of man, especially of woman, from the Equator to the Poles, demands personal adornment.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there are a few criteria for something to be considered money. It has to be a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit account. And looking through this story, the stones do appear to tick all the boxes.</p><br />\n<p>They are used for exchange. Although, mainly for high value transactions, as they are cumbersome and rare. These same two points also make them a rather convenient store of value &#8211; they were created hundreds of miles away, on another island, in another time, and are far too big to be stolen. And the book clearly denotes several goods in terms of the fei.</p><br />\n<p>The book even makes a halfhearted stab at connecting the stones with the labour theory of value.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Here then the simple-hearted natives of Yap, who never heard of Adam Smith nor of Ricardo, or even if they should hear of them would care no more for them than for an English song from the phonograph, have solved the ultimate problem of Political Economy, and found that labour is the true medium of exchange and the true standard of value.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there&#8217;s one great story that exemplifies the problem with taking this book at face value.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;my faithful old friend, Fatumak, assured me that there was in a village nearby a family whose wealth was unquestioned, &#8211; acknowledged by everyone, and yet no one, not even the family itself, had ever laid eye or hand on this wealth; it consisted of an enormous fei, whereof the size is known only tradition; for the past two or three generations it has been, and at that very time it was lying at the bottom of the sea!&#8230; The purchasing power of that stone remains&#8230; as valid as if it were leaning visibly against the side of the owner&#8217;s house&#8230;&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The entire thing is anecdote.

Hooke consistently got himself 90% of the way there, but it was others that scored the goals.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;Hooke is the man who almost made great discoveries now tied to the names and enduring fame of others: Boyle&#8217;s law of pressure of enclosed gases; Newton&#8217;s inverse square law of gravitational attraction; Huygen&#8217;s theory of the isochronous pendulum clock; <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/when-time-became-ubiquitous/\">Harrison&#8217;s longitude timekeeper</a>.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s the notion that Hooke came up with Newton&#8217;s inverse square law of gravity, or inspired it, or something in between, that best illustrates this point. From my little research, it seems clear that there is something to Hooke&#8217;s claim. But it was undoubtedly Newton that had the mathematical brilliance to prove it, and for that he is remembered and Hooke is not.</p><br />\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t enough to have the idea. The idea is nothing without execution.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;In Newton&#8217;s mind, priority lay with the person who had produced the mathematical proof of the elliptical motion of the planets, not the one who had proposed such a motion hypothetically in conversation, as part of a broad speculative discussion of planetary movement.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really recommend <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Curious-Life-of-Robert-Hooke/9780007151752/?a_aid=thambili\">The Curious Life of Robert Hooke by Lisa Jardine</a>.

These are the dots that Darwin eventually joined in his scientific work.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;At intervals in the five-year voyage, Darwin was able to spend a total of three years and one month on land, traveling widely&#8230; He shot a wide variety of birds and animals, went on an ostrich hunt, studied the effects of a large-scale earthquake, observed a major volcanic eruption, and visited at length tropical rain forests, high mountains, sierras, pampas and other grasslands, rivers, lakes, and a wide variety of scrub and brushwood areas, as well as scores of native villages, settler towns, mines, and cities.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see from that one passage, Darwin was voracious.  In an age of specialisation, its easy to forget that people like Darwin dabbled, slowly expanding horizons and building up the bricolage.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;In 1838 he came across&#8230; Malthus&#8217;s Essay on Population&#8230; This had a huge emotional impact on him, equivalent to the ones he had felt when he first experienced the savages of Tierra del Fuego&#8230;&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;He liked to have several projects going at once and switch from one to another as the spirit or the excitement generated by results moved him &#8211; from zoology to botany to physiology or anthropology, from insects to plants, the invertebrates, to men, and back to insects again.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The voracity of the ideas doesn&#8217;t even seem to matter. Even in Darwin and Malthus&#8217; day, the evidence was against Malthus&#8217; Iron Law of Population. But it inspired something else and was reworked. The important point is to be open to fresh thinking.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Darwin was a polymath. It was his great strength. Without the breadth as well as the depth of his knowledge, it is doubtful whether Origin could have succeeded.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Darwin-Paul-Johnson/9780147509772/?a_aid=thambili\">great, short intro to Darwin</a>.

They are influenced by deliberation, by the chairman, by politics through appointment choices and by pressures in and out of election times; and by their pre-central-bank career and post-central-bank career plans. In this paper, the analysis is extended to include yet one more variable: ideologically influenced academic training.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Economics may be a special case here, as there is significant debate in some areas, with identifable ideological &quot;camps&quot;. And, in America at least, certain universities can be clearly identified with schools of thought.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Robert Hall already drew in 1976 a clear ideological and methodological line between two schools: the freshwater school (Midwest of the US: e.g. Chicago or Minnesota), for which the government is not capable of reviving the economy because fluctuations come from supply shifts as opposed to the saltwater school (in coastal US universities: e.g. Berkeley, Harvard or Princeton) which focuses on stimulating demand through government policies.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I am still astounded at the sheer length of time over which this effect can be observed. It goes to show how much an impact not only early ideas and influences can have, but social connections too. Your mentors, your friends, your favourite books and first job&#8230; Your choice of university is huge.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;earlier professional life is not the most important period for the formation of inflation preferences. Instead, we try to demonstrate the role of academic training and the socialisation that happens not in the different types of careers, but in the different types of universities.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can you think of any biases that still hang around from your university days?</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

The endless renditions of concertos, operas and symphonies went over my head. But the dotted references to Leopold Mozart, WolfGang Mozart&#8217;s father, humanises both the story and Mozart himself.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&quot;Leopold Mozart&#8230; the son of a bookbinder, was a well-educated man with a degree in philosophy who had come to Salzburg in his late teens and joined its musical fraternity as a valet instrumentalist.\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nHe loved music and became one of the most learned musicologists of his day. He specialised in the violin, and his Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule, published the year of Mozart&#8217;s birth, is not only a handbook of instruction but a theoretical work that made him well known in musical circles throughout Europe.&quot;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<p>Mozart didn&#8217;t suddenly appear, fully formed. He might have been phenomenally gifted from an early age, but that had to be nurtured by someone with time, passion and knowhow.</p><br />\n<p>Unfortunately, its these stories that often get lost. We value and laud the individual, not the village. Leopold Mozart was well known by his peers, but how many know him now?</p><br />\n<p>When you listen to Mozart&#8217;s music, if that is your wont, do you appreciate the wider sacrifice that went into the prodigy?</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n&quot;Leopold Mozart&#8217;s ability as a composer in addition to his work as a violin expert should not be underrated. But about 1760, according to Nannerl, he &quot;abandoned violin teaching and composing music to devote himself to educating his two children&quot;&#8230;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nAfter 1762 he composed rarely and never after 1770-71. He is often seen as a tyrant toward his children, but the fact is, he surrendered his own future as a musician for their sake, and their progress justified his sacrifice.&quot;\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>Definitely recommend <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Mozart-Life-Paul-Johnson/9780670026371/?a_aid=thambili\">Mozart by Paul Johnson</a>.

Rather, they are bothered by something that is often confounded with inequality: economic unfairness.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0082\">a paper published in Nature</a>.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Drawing upon laboratory studies, cross-cultural research, and experiments with babies and young children, we argue that humans naturally favour fair distributions, not equal ones, and that when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a really short paper, but the examples are pretty amazing. It is a really subtle difference they are trying to highlight, but the implications are huge.</p><br />\n<p>One example has six year-olds distributing erasers to boys who had cleaned up a room. Given an odd number of erasers, they chose to throw out the surplus rather than have an unequal distribution. This obviously leads to the conclusion that equality is important even among children.</p><br />\n<p>But a follow up study found that the children had no qualms about an unequal distribution when they were told that one of the boys had worked harder. This leads to the conclusion that fairness, in fact, is the objective. And it&#8217;s backed up by numerous examples, including that we are willing to cop inequality when the cause is chance.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We suggest that the perception that there is a preference for equality arises through an undue focus on special circumstances, often studied in the laboratory, where inequality and unfairness coincide. In most situations, however, including those involving real world distributions of wealth, people’s concerns about fairness lead them to favour unequal distributions.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that what really triggers us is the process, not the outcomes.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;It follows, then, that if one believes that (a) people in the real world exhibit variation in effort, ability, moral deservingness, and so on, and (b) a fair system takes these considerations into account, then a preference for fairness will dictate that one should prefer unequal outcomes in actual societies.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

There is one house in each street. The price of the houses (including the land) varies across streets and increases from 1 to 20 monotonically with the cheapest house being in the first street in the first suburb and the most expensive house being in the last street in the fourth suburb. The rental yield is assumed to be 5% and thus varies between 0.05 currency units for the cheapest house and 1 currency unit for the most expensive house.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;There are N players of the game. Each of them sequentially roll a die and buy the house (including the land it is built on) if the initial or remaining budget suffices. If the house has already been purchased by another player rent must be paid to the owner of the house.The default budget for each player is set equal to the amount that would be needed to buy x houses so that all houses can be sold on average.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Baur runs this simulation multiple ways, fiddling with starting capital, wages (the equivalent of passing Go), and rules around what causes the game to end. One thing is constant &#8211; the correlation between inequality and housing.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Interestingly, the correlation between house ownership and budgets across players remains close to one even for positive regular income parameters. This means that the regular income can decrease the inequality in ownership and capital wealth but not change the ranking of the players based on the house ownership.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;the simulations show that (i) inequality is a frequent phenomenon in the game, (ii) house prices increase both with higher starting capital and higher wages, (iii) wealth inequality falls if wages are sufficiently high relative to house price growth and (iv) inequality is extreme when players do not own any property. We compare the results with house prices and disposable income of eight industrial countries and find striking similarities with the model outcomes despite the model’s simplicity.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But my biggest takeaway is something this model makes implicit but is quite hidden in the real world &#8211; the real inequality is between those who are playing and those that haven&#8217;t started yet.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Whatever the dynamics of the inequality among the players of the game are, the inequality measured with those that are not (yet) part of the game, i.e. future players or future generations, almost always increases and can easily reach extreme values.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

But <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2973050\">an interesting paper</a> out of RMIT is framing it as a technological problem.</p><br />\n<p>The paper itself is an exploration of using a Blockchain for &quot;coordinating preferences&quot;, or what they call &quot;crypto democracy&quot;. But in setting the stage there is this amazing passage:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;technological and institutional changes have both expanded democratic possibilities and helped develop trust that individual votes — i.e. choices &#8211; are inputs into the social choice governed by the constitutional system. <strong>Technological advancement opens up alternative systems through which democracy might be practiced</strong>.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p><br />\n<p>It may seem obvious, but it&#8217;s worthwhile to dwell on the idea that our institutions were created for a context with entirely different technological boundaries.</p><br />\n<p>And historically, our institutions evolved as the technology did.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ancient Athenian democracy was organised predominately by sortition rather than representation. Several hundred offices, including the membership of the governing Council of the 500, were filled each year by random allotment.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Participation in the lottery was not compulsory, but for those who chose to do so, identification was verified by ownership of a bronze identity plate. These plates were slotted into a tall marble machine, the kleroterion, from which they were withdrawn according to the random roll of a dice. Offices were allocated on the basis of the order the plates were withdrawn.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The introduction of the kleroterion, alongside the identification controls of the bronze plates, provided a material increase in the ‘democraticness’ of Athenian democracy, according to that society’s own conceptions of participation. In that case, <strong>technology and technological change expanded the institutional possibilities of democracy and reduced the costs of those institutions</strong>.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p><br />\n<p>A lottery system, in other words, was not a Platonian ideal, but a beautiful, practical use of the tools at hand.</p><br />\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the proposal the paper goes on to flesh out.

I&#8217;ve alternately been calling it a series of economic biographies, and a sweeping history of political economy. The blurb refers to it as a &quot;survey&quot; of the characters that shaped economics.</p><br />\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure any of these really get at what makes it so wonderful.</p><br />\n<p>Nasar, who previously wrote A Beautiful Mind (which is not only a great movie but <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Beautiful-Mind-Sylvi-Nasar/9780571212927/?a_aid=thambili\">a fantastic book</a>), has weaved together both the lives and ideas of the giants of economics. From Malthus and Riccardo, right up to Amartya Sen.</p><br />\n<p>The first third of the book is straight up biography. Of Marx, Marshall, Webb, Fisher and Schumpter. Each chapter it&#8217;s own little world.</p><br />\n<p>Nasar beautifully builds a story of progress, of theory and worldview. From a world of harsh limits to entrepreneurial magic, from zero to positive sum, and back, from theories that resembled simple mechanics, to intricate and complex biology.</p><br />\n<p>But it&#8217;s the little vignettes of their lives that really make the book pop.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Marx never did step outside. He never bothered to learn English well. His world was restricted to a small circle of like-minded émigrés. His contacts with English working-class leaders were superficial. He never exposed his ideas to people who could challenge him on equal terms. His interaction with economists&#8230; whose ideas he wished to demolish, was nonexistent&#8230; Astonishglingly for the best friend of a factory owner and the author of some of the mos impassioned descriptions of mechanization&#8217;s horrors, Marx never visited a single English factory &#8211; or any factory at all until he went on a guided tour of a porcelain factory near Carlsbad, where he took the waters toward the end of his life.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>These little glimpses, the events that shaped their focus and reactions, really ground ideas that often feel abstract. They explain the blind spots and short sightedness that can be maddening in retrospect. These were people, not robots, whose theories and ideas were born out of lived experience and necessity.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;From the age of eight, he commuted daily by omnibus, ferry, and foot through the most noxious manufacturing districts and slums bordering the Thames. Marshall had been looking into the faces of poor people all his life.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another thing you can&#8217;t fail but notice is the sheer fortune. That, until Sen, they were exclusively white. And almost all were either independently wealthy or married into it.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Beatrice&#8217;s identity was shaped by having been born into Britain&#8217;s &quot;new ruling class,&quot; and her mind by having been &quot;brought up in the midst of the capitalist speculation&quot; and &quot;the restless spirit of big enterprise.&quot; As the historian Barbara Cain notes, Beatrice distinguished her class not by wealth but by the fact that it was &quot;a class of persons who habitually gave orders, but who seldom, if ever, executed the orders of other people.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the second and third parts of the book, the narrative switches. Rather than characters in self-contained chapters, the story hinges on the big events of the 20th century &#8211; the world wars, the depression, the rise of international institutions and decolonialism. Characters weave in and out of the narrative, based on their links, intellectual and personal, to events and each other.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;World War 1 destroyed globalisation, disrupted economic growth, severed physical, financial, and trade links, bankrupted governments and businesses, and led weak or populist regimes to rely on desperate measures that were supposed to head off revolutions but just as often hastened them. When the war was over, the victors as well as the vanquished were crippled by colossal debts and subjected to vicious attacks of inflation and deflation.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Against this backdrop some of the magic and mystery of their ideas disappears. Joseph Schumpeter, for instance, is widely lauded nowadays for &quot;creative destruction&quot; and an emphasis on entrepreneurialism. But this seems less like a flight of genius and more a position of necessity when you consider he was the Austrian finance minister in 1919.</p><br />\n<p>The country had been devastated by war, stripped of empire, and was faced with a blockade and dwindling reserves. With few resources at his command, it&#8217;s understandable Schumpeter put his faith in an X factor.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;[Schumpeter] believed that a shrunken Austria had the means to recover economically. His deepest conviction was that nations&#8217; resources matter less than what they did with what they had. As long as entrepreneurs were allowed to create new enterprises, the financial system was functioning efficiently, and there were not too many barriers to trade, society could regenerate itself. He rejected the popular assumption that economic viability depended on vast territories, huge populations, and natural resources.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course the elephant in the room here is Keynes. But he, too, gets brought back to earth with stories.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;For most of his twenties, Keynes was Britain&#8217;s resident expert on obscure currencies. Thinking about currencies got him into the habit of thinking about economies holistically instead of focusing on &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;labor&quot; or &quot;industry&quot; in isolation, and taught him how to draw salient conclusions from a handful of indicators. It also gave him a feeling for which government actions exerted systemic effects, like those of the moon on tides, instead of effects on a particular industry or group.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>None of this should take away from their brilliance. But it&#8217;s refreshing to get away from economics as received wisdom, or mathematical laws of nature, and into a world of messy identity and politics. <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Grand-Pursuit/9781841154565/?a_aid=thambili\">Grand Pursuit</a> is undoubtedly one of the best economics books I&#8217;ve ever read.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Newspapers harp on about it, investors set their expectations by it, politicians&#8217; careers live and die by it. But until I read <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/GDP-Diane-Coyle/9780691156798\">GDP: a brief but affectionate history</a> by Diane Coyle, I had never really appreciated how artificial the whole thing is.</p><br />\n<p>Of course, GDP isn&#8217;t a natural phenomena. There isn&#8217;t a GDP-shaped mountain range somewhere. Moses didn&#8217;t bring us tablets etched with the formula. But that&#8217;s not really it.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The concept of &#8216;national income&#8217; may seem clear enough, but measuring it in practice means choosing what to include and exclude, which is surprisingly fuzzy&quot;.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see, from the start, our measurements were both malleable and rife with ideology. Obvious, you may say. But what we choose to include and exclude ultimately shapes how we view the world. And this is largely invisible. No one can &quot;see&quot; the economy. Very few can or do investigate the statistics. Instead, we go with the heuristics.</p><br />\n<p>You may hold in your head that economics is a human construct but still come under the influence of its selective view of the world.</p><br />\n<p>According to Adam Smith&#8217;s definition of productive labour, for example, <em>&quot;only those involved in the making of physical commodities, agriculture and industry would count toward national income.&quot;</em></p><br />\n<p>The very essence of what is &quot;productive&quot; is a construct that has changed over time. And changed massively.</p><br />\n<p>But perhaps Coyle&#8217;s most cogent example of this artifice is military spending. Again to Smith:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;money spent on warfare or the interest on government debt was also being used unproductively. The nation&#8217;s wealth was its stock of physical assets less the national debt. National income was what derived from the national wealth.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two things.</p><br />\n<p>First, compare this to the current system, which is essentially a measure of flows of income, expenditure and production, rather than a measure of assets or liabilities. Change.</p><br />\n<p>Secondly, how big would our modern militaries be if their expenditure was still considered a drain on the national accounts? In fact, Simon Kuznets, the father of national accounts, originally tried to count military spending as a negative to the national output.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Kuznets, however, specifically saw his task as working out how to measure national economic welfare rather than just output.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;With this aim, in fact, Kuznets was out of tune with his times. Welfare was a peacetime luxury&#8230; Before long, the president would want a way of measuring the economy that did indicate its total capacity to produce but did not show additional government expenditure on armaments as reducing the nation&#8217;s output.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Politics. With the Second World War approaching, governments needed to ramp up military spending. But, as now, the heuristic of growth held sway over the electorate. It&#8217;s an easy mental shortcut. So, the government changed the national accounts to include military spending on the &quot;plus&quot; side.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;By the time the wartime economists developed the modern concept of GDP, government was already a far greater presence that it had been. Subtracting Defense spending from the older conception of national income would have wrongly given the impression that the war effort was going to involve a huge sacrifice in private consumer spending.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;&#8230;early definitions of &quot;national income&quot; did not include government spending, because governments before the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had such limited functions. Paying for war, or similarly for the justice system, was seen as a necessary evil reducing national income, rather than a positive contribution to the economy.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<p>Of course, we can extend this. There are plenty of things inexplicably included or excluded from our national accounting.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The main reason for not counting unpaid housework as part of &quot;the economy&quot;, while paid housework is counted, is the difficulty of measuring it. Well, difficulty is not the right word. It can be measured by surveys, like the many other economic statistics, but generally official statistical agencies have never bothered &#8211; perhaps because it has been carried out mainly by women.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>We all need to remember this the next time politicians tout growth. We&#8217;ve chosen what goes into growth and what doesn&#8217;t. Our figures only show us changes in what we choose to count, what we currently find &quot;important&quot;. They say more about our current priorities than anything else.</p><br />\n<p>None of our measures are immutable laws of nature. They are subject to whims and change.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The imaginary line dividing productive from unproductive activity is called the &quot;production boundary.&quot; There is no sharp division in reality, so at the boundary there are arbitrary decisions, and this can be simply a matter of convenience. The border also becomes self-fulfilling, though, as being included in the national accounts definition of GDP is taken as a mark of &quot;productiveness.&quot;</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>I really recommend <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/GDP-Diane-Coyle/9780691156798\">GDP: a brief but affectionate history</a> by Diane Coyle</em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

But it is an ancient art. Composting pits were used by the citizens of Knossos in Crete four thousand years ago.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we&#8217;ve been doing this a while. It wasn&#8217;t invented by the gluten intolerant.</p><br />\n<p>But Johnson keeps going, and starts making interesting allusions to the natural world.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>We value tropical rain forests because they squander so little of the energy supplied by the sun, thanks to their vast, interlocked system of organisms exploiting every tiny niche of the nutrient cycle. The diversity of the system is precisely why rain forests do such a brilliant job of capturing the energy that flows through them: one organism captures a certain amount of energy, but in processing that energy, it generates waste. In an efficient system, that waste becomes a new source of energy for another creature in the chain.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the magic – our cities were once ecosystems like this. Before we went to extraordinary lengths to haul stuff out of sight and mind, we had to do something with it. We, too, created energy and input loops. And they helped build our modern world.</p><br />\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Waste recycling — in the form of composting and manure spreading — played a crucial role in the explosive growth of medieval European towns. High-density collections of human beings, by definition, require significant energy inputs to be sustainable, starting with reliable supplies of food.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The towns of the Middle Ages lacked highways and container ships to bring them sustenance, and so their population sizes were limited by the fecundity of the land around them. If the land could grow only enough food to sustain five thousand people, then five thousand people became the ceiling. But by plowing their organic waste back into the earth, the early medieval towns increased the productivity of the soil, thus raising the population ceiling, thereby creating more waste—and increasingly fertile soil.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The collecting of human excrement was a venerable occupation; in medieval times they were called “rakers” and “gong-fermors,” and they played an indispensable role in the waste-recycling system that helped London grow into a true metropolis, by selling the waste to farmers outside the city walls.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s an obvious reason Sri Lankans and eighteen century Londoners are careful with waste. And despite the veneration, I doubt anyone really chose to be an 18th century &quot;raker&quot;.</p><br />\n<p>That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m advocating. But the mindset is. Let&#8217;s go back to thinking of waste as an input. Just think of all the potential we are squandering.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I wanted to add to <a href=\"https://joshnicholas.com/nothing-is-obvious/\">something I just wrote about</a> – the construction of our realities. It’s a topic much enriched by Gillian Tett’s brilliant book, <a href=\"http://www.bookdepository.com/Silo-Effect-Gillian-Tett/9781844087587/?a_aid=thambili\">The Silo Effect</a>.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n…humans always assume that the way that they organize the world around them is entirely natural and inevitable.\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>So, Tett’s book is primarily a reaction to the Global Financial Crisis. An anthropologist by training, she started to question why traders in the same bank were making opposing bets, how risk analysts could have been so blissfully unaware of the downside of some of these trades, and how economists and regulators missed the forrest for the trees.</p><br />\n<p>The answer, she claims, is our unfortunate tendency to break the world down into neat little boxes. This can be effective, and even necessary, in our taking in and understanding the world. But the siloisation of expertise, information and people can be dangerous.</p><br />\n<p>And it’s also not very accurate.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\nA common theme of anthropological research is that the way we classify the world never really matches the reality of our environments. People might draw neat diagrams of their kinship structures and family trees, but there are often ambiguities, overlaps, and underlaps. Things fall between the cracks. Life does not always fit into the official descriptions of what people are supposed to do. Much of the time we ignore these messy realities. It feels easier to stick with the neat classification systems we have than constantly rewrite them, be that in the sphere of kinship, religion, domestic life, or anything else.\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>If you watched any of this year’s campaign coverage, this should be familiar to you. Analysts broke America down into categories – white voters, women voters, black voters, latino voters, rural voters, working class voters; they ascribed motivations and prescribed answers.</p><br />\n<p>But the world doesn’t want to conform to our little boxes. When it comes to institutions this can cause confusion, blindness and infighting. And, guess what, it does that in politics too. Maybe it’s time to question the boxes.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n…the conventions that we use to classify the world are often not officially defined or spelled out. Instead, they arise out of a dense set of rules, traditions, and conventions that we have absorbed from our surroundings, often in an unthinking way.\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Not based on polls or probabilistic models, but my perception of the way the world works.</p><br />\n<p>Trump just doesn’t get elected in a country with well-developed institutions, I thought. This is <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa\">something that happens in Sri Lanka</a>.</p><br />\n<p>It’s this sense of certainty that I now find most interesting. It was <em>obvious</em> to me that Trump would not win. And this was shared by everyone I spoke to, both before and after the event.</p><br />\n<p>But this certainty, especially this shared sense of the obvious, is a problem. As explained by Dave Gray in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Liminal-Thinking-Create-Change-Changing/dp/1933820462\">Liminal Thinking</a>:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The obvious is not obvious. It is constructed. We work together, as individuals and in groups, to construct the obvious every day. We band together in “obvious clubs” that defend competing versions of reality. When you walk into your obvious club, you will find people reading the same books, watching the same news channels, and talking to the same people, all of which tends to reinforce the same version of reality.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of reality as a construct is not new. We filter our world through a lense, one made up of our experiences and beliefs. But the idea of a mutually constructed obvious – what one might call <em>common sense</em> – rather than an inherited or inherent one, is a new framing for me.</p><br />\n<p>And this rings especially true as I think back on my many conversations about this election. So many of which were kicked off by the realisation we had read the same article or listened to the same podcast. It wasn’t just that my friends and I arrived at the election from the same place – as outsiders looking in. We were searching for bricks and gluing them together in our conversations.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think something is obvious, that’s an idea that bears closer examination. Why do you think it’s obvious? What personal experiences have you had that led to that belief? Can you imagine a different set of experiences that might lead to a different belief?</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s a whole bunch of people taking a hard look at their priors right now, talking about breaking outside their bubbles. This is where you should start. There is no inherent obvious.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Just in the past few weeks I have been trying to <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BLf31hEh-G3/\">learn how to pick locks</a>, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BLrpdfEBTIQ/\">make soap</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BG8TCrhE-gd/\">build an aquaponic setup</a>. And those are just the things I can link to (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshcnicholas/\">follow me on Instagram</a>).</p><br />\n<p>I’ve often considered this a negative. My inability to focus on just one thing means I inevitably have less subject knowledge than someone who specialises. My knowledge is wide but not really deep. I can talk to almost anyone, about almost anything, but not for very long.</p><br />\n<p>But just in time for some post hoc justification, economist Tim Harford has written a book that makes it all ok. It’s called <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Messy/9781594634796/?a_aid=thambili\">Messy</a> and it’s an examination of the beauty of chaos. Most of the media coverage has concentrated on Harford’s message that untidy desks and workspaces can be a boon, but it really extends far beyond that. From the power of improvised speeches through random events that upset path dependence in your daily commute.</p><br />\n<p>And riddled throughout are some amazing anecdotes just for curious people like me.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The top scientists switched topics frequently. Over the course of their first hundred published papers, the long-lived high-impact researchers switched topics an average of 43 times. The leaps were less dramatic than the ones Erez Aiden likes to take, but the pattern is the same: the top scientists keep changing the subject if they wish to stay productive.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The researchers investigated the creative habits of almost a hundred exceptionally creative people, including performers such as Ravi Shankar; Paul MacCready, who built the first human-powered aeroplane; Nobel laureates in literature such as Nadine Gordimer; twelve-time Emmy award-winning TV producer Joan Konner; great non-fiction writers such as Stephen Jay Gould; and a pair of double Nobel laureates, Linus Pauling and John Bardeen. Every single one of this galaxy of creative stars had multiple projects on the go at the same time.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Charles Darwin, who throughout his life alternated between research in geology, zoology, psychology and botany, always with some projects in the foreground and others in the background competing for his attention. He undertook his celebrated voyage on the Beagle with ‘an ample and unprofessional vagueness in his goals’.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a few reasons Harford gives for the benefits of bouncing between projects. But in the end it seems to come back to something I have written about before – <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/\">the necessity of letting in as many influences as you can</a>. There are some great rewards to be reaped by expanding your adjacent possible. Just think how important the interplay of geology, zoology, psychology and botany were in Darwin’s work. Would his theorising have been at all possible if he was a specialist?</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The practical benefit is that the multiple projects cross-fertilise one another. The knowledge gained in one enterprise provides the key to unlock another. This is Erez Aiden’s advantage. He moves back and forth across his network of enterprises, solving an impasse on one project with ideas from another or unexpectedly fusing two disparate lines of work.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p><!----></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The psychological advantages may be just as important. First, the point emphasised by Brian Eno, is that a fresh context is exciting; having several projects may seem distracting, but instead the variety grabs our attention like a tourist gawping at details that a local would find mundane.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven’t enjoyed a non-fiction book this much in a long time. Not least because it justified my natural proclivities and confirmed my bias. Chaos is a fun topic and the sheer breadth of examples Harford employs keep it very fresh.

It was a quest that lasted for hundreds of years, fuelled by rivalry, prejudice, discovery and war (also, a smidge of science).</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lines of latitude and longitude began crisscorssing our worldview in ancient times, at least three centuries before the birth of Christ. By A.D. 150, the cartographer and astronomer Ptolemy had plotted them on the twenty-seven maps of his first world atlas.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But while it’s easy to take a ruler to a map, orienting yourself on that map is another problem entirely. Especially so at sea, where landmarks are scarce. Lacking a way to devise longitude, countless lost their lives to navigational mistakes; shipwrecking or becoming hopelessly lost.</p><br />\n<p>Luminaries from Galileo to Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke, as well as countless in between, worked to find a solution. Some were brilliant, if impractical – deriving longitude from the moon and stars; some were plain bizarre – a combination of magic powder and injured dogs.</p><br />\n<p>In the end it came down to time. If you know the exact time where you are, as well as at your point of origin, longitude is child’s play to calculate. But creating an accurate timekeeper in the steampunk age, let alone one that holds up to a battering at sea, defied the best minds. In the end it was an uneducated carpenter named John Harrison who solved the problem.</p><br />\n<p>He changed the world.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some modern horologists claim that Harrison’s work facilitated England’s mastery over the oceans, and thereby led to the creation of the British Empire — for it was by dint of the chronometer that Britainnia ruled the waves.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the thing that has really played on my mind over the past couple of days is not this “big history” aspect. Rather, Harrison and his clock marks the end of being without time. Our lives are so regimented now, everything on a schedule. And that’s before we even consider the important timekeeping continues to play in making our world smaller – through its <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\">use in GPS</a> for example.</p><br />\n<p>Harrison extended rigorous timekeeping beyond cumbersome and stationary pendulum clocks, invented parts that can still be found in modern clocks, and brought time to the waves. It was through Harrison that time conquered the world.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>With his marine clocks, John Harrison tested the waters of space-time. He succeeed, against all odds, in using the fourth-temporal-dimension to link points on the three-dimensional globe. He wrested the world’s whereabouts from the stars, and locked the secret in a pocket watch.</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really recommend <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili\">Sobel’s book</a>.

For instance, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thinkdigitalfutures/are-we-doing-the-right-thing-with-tech-in-schools\">talking to primary school children who can already do more with their phones than I can</a>.</p><br />\n<p>This point was really rammed home when I cracked open <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Program-or-be-Programmed-Douglas-Rushkoff/9781593764265\">Program or be Programmed</a> by Douglas Rushkoff.</p><br />\n<p>The entire book is a plea to take control of the devices that have become so enmeshed in our lives. But it’s this bit early on that really makes it plain:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The people hear while the rabbis read; the people read while those with access to the printing press write; today we write, while our techno-elite programs. As a result, most of society remains one full dimensional leap of awareness and capability behind the few who manage to monopolize access to the real power of any media age.</p><br />\n<p>And this time the stakes are actually higher. Before, failing meant surrendering our agency to a new elite. In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves. The process appears to have already begun.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rushkoff has put coding into a continuum that includes literacy and mass media. Just think of the power that has accumulated to those who could read while the masses were unlettered, who could reach everyone while the rest of us shout in the wind.</p><br />\n<p>And it’s not just that literacy and mass reach bestowed power, they did so in ways that no one could foresee, and that the unempowered didn’t understand.</p><br />\n<p>But what started as superpowers of the rich and initiated, that for a time were specialist jobs (scribes and journalists), have been extended to all of us. Became required of all of us. And we are all richer for it.</p><br />\n<p>Coding will be the same. It’s not going to remain a specialist activity, the purview of unseen developers, but will become as common as writing.</p><br />\n<p>The other day I met a girl who had created an app so she could share the books she had read with her friends. A boy had been given an assignment to learn his school timetable, and so had created an app to automatically give himself reminders in the morning. These are primary school students.</p><br />\n<p>Yes, these are really banal problems. But that’s exactly why they’re proof of how important coding will be. Technology is ubiquitous. Offline and online are being melded. Coding isn’t just about creating the next Google, but about fully realising something that is everywhere. Those of us who can’t, will be the unlettered of the modern age.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Meanwhile, the European unemployment rate is heading in the right direction, but is <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/unemployment-rate\">still shockingly high</a>, especially in <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate\">some states</a>, leaving the spectre of a lost generation.

That the <em>other</em>, especially an easily demonised <em>other</em>, is feeling the brunt. People are genuinely worried about putting food on the table, for their futures and children — let’s not go into zero-sum thinking fostered by our politicians and education systems.</p><br />\n<p>The point is, this isn’t a debate you can tackle with “well, it’s the least we can do”. You need an equally self-interested argument. And I may have found one.</p><br />\n<p>I’ve just finished the first chapter of <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1TPIKH1\">The Geography of Genius</a>, a splendidly written first-person investigation of the connection between place and ideas. The author, Eric Weiner, is a long-time foreign correspondent and travel writer, so you can imagine the beautiful language and imagery.</p><br />\n<p>Anyway, the first chapter is an investigation of ancient Athens. Why was this one place the progenitor of so much we take for granted — art, science, finance, literature, philosophy, and politics etc.? This is especially remarkable given the short span of Athen’s golden age, and that it wasn’t the richest or biggest of the Greek states.</p><br />\n<p>The Athenians were particularly creative — dare I say, innovative. And the reason why comes back to <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/\">something I’ve written about before</a> — they had a lot of raw material. Athens was an incredibly open place, it’s people travelling widely, and, extraordinarily for the time, foreigners were allowed to come and thrive. All of these influences came together and mixed, illustrating deficiencies not immediately apparent to locals, surfacing solutions from far and wide.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The ancient Greeks didn’t invent much at all. They were, in fact, tremendous moochers. They borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, medicine and sculpture from the Egyptians, mathematics from the Babylonians, literature from the Sumerians. They felt no shame in their intellectual pilfering. The Athenians, for all their many flaws (see slavery and treatment of women), didn’t suffer from the Not Invented Here complex.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This willingness to borrow, steal, and embellish distinguished Athens from its neighbors. Athenians were more open to foreign ideas and, in the final analysis, more open-minded. At the symposia, they enjoyed the poetry of outsiders as much as that of locals. They incorporated many foreign words into their vocabulary and even began wearing foreign clothes. Athens was both Greek and foreign, in much the way that New York is an American city and not.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>At one point, Weiner very clearly links this openness and cross-pollination to commerce. Something we can see in some of today’s more interesting technology companies — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransferWise\">Transferwise</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp\">WhatsApp</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)\">Telegram</a> were all founded by immigrants and exiles, largely solving problems not evident in their new homes. Nevertheless, they bring an incredible amount of wealth and expertise. Would any of these countries be better for locking them out?</p><br />\n<p>The reverse example is also present, as evidenced by Facebook’s spectacular failure to bring Free Basics to India, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/why-facebook-and-marc-andreessen-offended-india-with-good-intentions-20160216-gmv4u4\">largely thanks to a lack of cultural awareness</a>. Diversity is an incredibly powerful facet in the creation and dissemination of ideas. Even if you don’t immediately benefit from the diversity, you may do so indirectly — you might not get a job with Facebook, but your life is undoubtedly richer from greater access to friends and family.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Athenians, master shipbuilders and sailors, journeyed to Egypt, Mesopotamia, and beyond and brought back every good imaginable. Embedded in those goods were some stowaways: ideas.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ideas insert themselves into the fiber of merchandise and lie dormant until a careful observer unlocks them. This is why authoritarian regimes that believe they can open their economies but not their politics are fooling themselves. It may take a while, but eventually these subversive ideas, embedded in a can of tomato soup or a pair of Crocs, squirm free.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of my favourite classes during university was a history of China, a central theme being the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism#China\">country’s cycles of expansion and isolation</a>, and the accompanying booms and busts. Similarly, it can be argued that much of America’s success over the past hundred years comes from its immigration policy, its openness. Its being built on an idea, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-america-is-being-changed--but-by-whom/2016/02/11/834d3dca-d105-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html\">rather than a foundation of race, ethnicity or religion</a>. We have so much evidence that openness works, that closing doors is nothing more than self harm.</p><br />\n<p>Unfortunately, much of these issues are viewed through a zero-sum lens. Each additional immigrant is feared as a source of more competition, rather than for any of the number of benefits they provide. As fellow consumers, helping to foster demand and bring economies of scale. As more-mobile workers, smoothing out booms and busts throughout he country. And, maybe more importantly, as a source of diversity, helping us plug gaps, learn from the countless natural experiments going on, and enriching our culture. Taking in more refugees and immigrants isn’t just a moral concern, we are all the beneficiaries of millennia of mixing cultures.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve recently entered the mind of a genius. It’s a book called <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1THQXNo\">Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman</a>, a weird amalgam of biography and autobiography of Richard Feynman. Feynman, Nobel prize winner and popular science communicator, was an insatiably curious character – my train trip home was spent in wonderment at a series of experiments he did on ants, using Rube Goldberg-esque tests to try and figure out how they communicate with each other. But his antics extended far beyond this, to safe cracking, bongo playing and much more.</p><br />\n<p>But it’s a short anecdote from early in his studies that really grabbed my attention this morning. Feynman, then a graduate physics student at Princeton, decided to take a course in biology. Because of course he did. Given a paper to read and present to the class, his reaction is brilliant.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>”When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles.<br />\nThe other students in the class interrupt me: ‘We know all that!’<br />\n‘Oh,’ I say, ‘you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you’ve had four years of biology.’ They had wasted all their time memorising stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.’”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the way we educate, test, live and learn is broken, is not a new argument on this blog. But consider the context of this reaction. This is Feynman in the early 1940s. When knowledge was still locked away in expensive books, guarded by jealous librarians. Long before search engines, hyperlinks, the mass digitisation of books and online encyclopaedias. Yet Feynman was already decrying our fetishisation of memorisation over understanding.</p><br />\n<p>What excuse do we have now?</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>”I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Rants about <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/a-one-quote-summary-of-a-problem-in-our-education-system/\">our stupid industrial model</a>, on how we need <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/i-wish-i-had-been-unschooled/\">something that more conforms with the needs of the modern day</a> – curiosity, critical thinking, and research over rote.</p><br />\n<p>But even within our terrible model there are inequities to address. Some states are far better at turning out widget-people than others. Countries like Australia are <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/the-toughest-question-of-all-why-is-australia-falling-behind-in-maths-20150706-gi5ztd.html\">falling behind in international rankings</a>. And the way we approach teachers and teaching may be a big reason why.</p><br />\n<p>I’m about halfway through <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1YG0c3P\">Free Schools</a> by David Gillespie. It’s essentially an examination of the Australian education system, from the point of view of a parent trying to decide whether to send his children to a government or “private” school. Gillespie scrutinises a lot of factors – class and school size, religion, gender and age segregation, government schools, charter schools, unions etc. etc.</p><br />\n<p>There’s a lot of stuff to unpack here, which I hope to get to eventually. But something I read on the train this morning has stuck. A lot of the countries that are succeeding in our broken system have a great approach to teachers and teaching. They emphasise it as a craft and provide a method for constant finessing.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A Shanghai teacher with less than five years’ experience is assigned two mentors, one for classroom management and one for subject-specific guidance. The mentors are teachers with five to ten years’ experience.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Gillespie, teachers in Shanghai have enormous space and resources to improve their craft. They are given a three-year development plan, and mentors to act both as examples (they spend days observing their mentors’ classes), as well as to provide feedback on their own teaching practices (the mentors sit in classes and give them advice on teaching plans and delivery). As teachers progress through their career they are given increasingly experienced mentors, and they themselves become mentors. They aren’t promoted out of the classroom, their talent and expertise isn’t incentivised to leave the system.</p><br />\n<p>The teacher’s are also leaned upon to help improve the system from within. To critically analyse it from the front line. They join groups aimed at improving student results, to research, evaluate and apply strategies to make schools and education more effective. They conduct their own original research, submitting papers to academic journals. They are, in other words, treated in a similar fashion to lawyers, doctors or any other knowledge professional.</p><br />\n<p>This is all <strong>after</strong> they have graduated, and <strong>continues well into their careers</strong>.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[in Shanghai] teachers are expected to learn following the cycle of study–practise–analyse then start again.”</p><br />\n<p>“There’s a constant and pervasive culture of teacher-performance mentoring – not monitoring, mentoring. Teachers are treated like the professionals they are.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the complete opposite to how Australia has tackled improving education – playing on the margins by focusing on superficial gains like reducing class size (this has not proven effective). As Gillespie points out, painfully, over and over, the concept of teaching as a skill is absent in our discourse. We leave our teachers alone, on an island with their students. We don’t support them the way Shanghai does, or encourage them to improve the system. And education largely ends at uni. What little further training they get is spotty, and largely centred around things they might need to teach – not teaching itself.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Australian teachers reported that they received little or no constructive feedback from the programs, it was rarely based on classroom observation and, as a result, it was disconnected from student learning. Most teacher professional development consisted of attendance at one-off courses and wasn’t part of any longer term collaborative research program.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a big caveat here. The countries Gillespie namedrops are different to ours in fundamental ways. Age and governance-wise yes, but also culturally. Many of these well-performing countries are what’s known as collectivist cultures, <a href=\"http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Collectivist_and_individualist_cultures\">while we are individualist</a>. Collectivist cultures, like that of China and Japan, emphasize group goals above individual needs or desire. See if you can catch a hint of that in this quote:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Asian and Finnish school teachers are not compensated based on their students’ performance, they work together as professionals to ensure they’re all more effective teachers. That students perform better is an outcome of better teaching, not a means of calculating the teachers’ weekly salary.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would assume our emphasis on incentive structure and individuals probably has a lot to do with our individualist culture. Although don’t quote me on that. The main point is, countries like China obviously have a much healthier take on how to treat and train teachers.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

And Zucman’s is interesting.</p><br />\n<p>Zucman’s plan comes in two parts – the creation of a global register of financial instruments, and a tax levied on the lot. The combination of the two would negate the benefit of profit shifting – the tax is global, and of secrecy – in order to claim deductions or benefit from lower local taxes you would need to file a return.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“imagine a global tax of 0.1% on the stock of wealth withheld at the source. This means that each year tax authorities, drawing on the information in the register, would deduct 0.1% of the value of all financial securities, bank accounts, and so on.”<br />\n“In order to recover what has been taken from them, US taxpayers, for example, would have only one solution: declare their holdings on their IRS tax returns. Subject to this declaration, they would receive a credit for any taxes that remain due—or see themselves reimbursed if they owe no taxes at all.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is the combination of these two ideas, really, that is the breakthrough. A global financial register alone won’t achieve much – we will have a comprehensive list of “owners” of financial instruments, but much of it will remain opaque as shell corporations and tax havens muddy the waters. By leveraging a tax, even if net revenue is zero, we gain. We force opacity.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Without a wealth tax, there is a risk that even a global register might fail to identify who exactly owns what. Despite anti-laundering legislation that requires financial institutions to know who the owners of the wealth that they have in their accounts truly are, a not negligible portion of the securities could continue to be recorded in a register as belonging to trusts without a well-identified owner.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s throughout this explanation of the solution, that you really see the hole in the plan. Zucman is constantly at pain to justify himself, that his ideas aren’t utopian – in fact, they are all currently in play on a smaller scale. Constantly referenced, the word <em>utopia</em> makes its presence uncomfortable.</p><br />\n<p>What’s stopping us tackling tax evasion isn’t a lack of ideas – even if you don’t appreciate Zucman’s. It isn’t even sovereignty, as something like Zucman’s tax allows for states to set and differ in their policies. It’s that the people in power, many of whom benefit from the status quo, need to be convinced to do something. That’s the utopia.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Part history, part thesis, part guide. It sent me down more than one rabbit hole, as I sought to explore Johnson’s anecdotes and ideas.</p><br />\n<p>The book is built upon a central proposition, one I mentioned in a <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/you-are-what-you-let-in/\">previous post</a> – our ideas are the sum of our influences. Johnson puts this more artfully:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ideas are works of bricolage; they’re built out of that detritus. We take the ideas we’ve inherited or that we’ve stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>This premise inevitably leads to several interesting conclusions. If innovation is fuelled by what has come before, the trope of the solitary inventor is nonsensical. So is the image of breakthroughs as the product of “eureka” moments rather than steady contemplation- something for which Johnson expresses particular disdain. Rather, new and good ideas are the product of openness, mixing and reflection.</p><br />\n<p>It’s important, then, to be open to new things, in whatever guise. Your influences are the raw material of your ideas. As they expand so will your pool of potential ideas. Johnson illustrates this using the most powerful and beautiful idea in the book, one which he stole from biologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman\">Stuart Kauffman</a> – the adjacent possible.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>As originally conceived by Kauffman, the adjacent possible defined all the possible chemical reactions, the total amount of combinations, that could be achieved in the primordial soup. There is a finite number of combinations that can be made, but this number grows as each new combination brings with it more possibilities.</p><br />\n<p>The more you add to the mix, the more you remix, the more possibilities. The boundaries recede. Ideas are just like this.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The adjacent possible is as much about limits as it is about openings. At every moment in the timeline of an expanding biosphere, there are doors that cannot be unlocked yet.”</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<p>“Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn’t have reached from your original starting point.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key for all of us, then, is to expand our own adjacent possible. To keep introducing new sources, new raw material. The limit to your creative potential is what you let in.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The history of life and human culture, then, can be told as the story of a gradual but relentless probing of the adjacent possible, each new innovation opening up new paths to explore.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Luck and skill are the only real impediments to my tweets, posts, updates or snaps setting the internet ablaze. The same can be said across industries and professions, as technology demolishes gatekeepers, shirks distance and weakens the moat of expertise.</p><br />\n<p>It’s not quite right that all you need is a good idea. But almost. It definitely helps. The thing is, where do you get the idea? Where do they come from?</p><br />\n<p>I’ve been taking a look at writing on creativity in the past week, reading <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1W92N7L\">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> by Steven Johnson, and devouring <a href=\"http://amzn.to/237GKDM\">Steal Like An Artist</a> by Austin Kleon. Actually, I’ve well and truly fallen down the Kleon rabbit hole. I’m halfway through his second book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/228Skc6\">Show Your Work</a>, and have spent far too much time on <a href=\"http://austinkleon.com/\">his blog</a>.</p><br />\n<p>It was an idea from early in Steal Like An Artist that really captured my imagination. Kleon is rather insistent on the concept that everything new is inherently informed by what has come before. There are no new ideas, but plays on old ones. Borrowings, remixes and mashups. As a result, it is vitally important to watch what you allow in. What you consume is directly tied to what you create.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Just as you have a familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas. You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar idea runs through Johnson’s book, which is full of beautiful examples of inventors “borrowing” from other fields. My favourite is Gutenberg, whose printing press repurposed a bunch of pre-existing technologies – movable type, ink, paper, and the wine press – a tool ubiquitous in his homeland. The Gutenberg press wasn’t the result of a stroke of brilliance, a revolution or technological leap forward, but of remixing things that already existed.</p><br />\n<p>Of course, it’s not enough to just open your mind and let all the good stuff in. After all, I have far more access to ideas and information than any of my 17th century heroes. So Johnson introduces another, related idea, the commonplace book:</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters – just about anyone with intellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to keep a commonplace book. The great minds of the period – Milton, Bacon, Locke – were zealous believers in the memory-enhancing powers of the commonplace book.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In its most customary form, “commonplacing,” as it was called, involved transcribing interesting or inspirational passages from one’s reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imbibing good stuff is the first step. From there, you need to do something with it. Write it down. Try and draw some connections. Read and re read it. Apparently this was something Darwin was wont to do, as he not only took down new ideas, but reasoned them out on paper.</p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.”</p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Taking care to constantly root his observations in humanity, Ross rapidly sweeps through the roles that will be played by robotics, code, data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and much more. By grounding his observations in humanity I am referring to repeated references to history, perception and anecdote.</p><br />\n<p>An unfortunate many of these kinds of books end up defeated by their own techno-utopianism. Written by participants or long-time watchers, many fail to grasp the effects so much of this change will have on those currently out of the loop – without capital, connections, requisite knowledge, who live in the periphery, or are the wrong gender or race. Ross takes a global view here, and his coverage of advances in Africa, especially, was better than I had seen before. He has a remarkable point of view – growing up the child of immigrants and relatively poor, but most recently coming in contact with many leaders of countries, companies and academia. The diversity of coverage and emphasis is not perfect, obviously, but better than I’ve seen.</p><br />\n<p>I’ve already touched on a lot of this book, but I want to talk a little bit about Estonia, which features prominently in the final chapters. Estonia, a country of just over a million people, has a government determined to be at the forefront of the many changes Ross notes. With such a small population, and unable to put up barriers due to its membership of the Eurozone, this makes sense. But even more, Estonia has embraced the mindset of technology. It enshrined internet access as a human right in 2000, started teaching coding in the first grade, created an “e-residency” program to become a gateway to business services, and has rapidly moved to put as many government services online as it can.</p><br />\n<p>In other words, Estonia has recognised that technology will mean ever more competition. And the only way to survive an increasingly winner-take-all world, is to equip yourselves and become a first mover. Even better, technology is levelling the playing field in many areas. As these quotes attest:</p><br />\n<blockquote><p>\n“[Estonian President Toomas Hendrik] Ilves thinks that the advancement of robotics serves Estonia well by giving the small countries of the world the chance to compete on the global stage with actors like China and India. He told me <em>‘It will increase our functional size tremendously because people don’t have to do things the machines can do.’</em> Estonia has only 1.3 million citizens.”\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n“How does a little country like Estonia compete in the same global marketplace as China, which has a labor force a little more than 1,000 times the size of its own? It takes advantage of the fact that robots enable a relatively small workforce to produce higher levels of output than would be the case in an all-human workforce. Estonia and China will never be equal competitors by sole virtue of their difference in size, but Estonia can compete at a level far above what its size would suggest by virtue of being cutting-edge in the field of robotics as both producer and consumer.”\n</p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>Fears of losing legacy businesses and mass structural unemployment have caused many countries to pause for too long, and even <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/how-much-more-would-we-have-benefited-from-laws-that-kept-up/\">try to fend off progress</a>. But the world is being upended, and as President Ilves points out, our conceptions of what makes a comparative advantage are going to change dramatically, and very soon.</p><br />\n<p>Will the raw materials of the information age be base metals? How can large populations continue to provide an economic boon as cheap manufacturing is done by robots, while social welfare systems remain? Do roads matter as much as internet access as location becomes less important? What gives a nation advantage in the future is likely to be very different from what we’ve seen before. We need to position ourselves to take advantage of them.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

In doing so, you run the very high risk of spending on something that’s an average idea.”</em></p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>A running theme throughout Flynn’s story are the odds in the way &#8211; his organisation, often buoyed only by belief and passionate supporters, facing off against entrenched interests and disbelieving middlemen. The story of Thankyou becomes the story of finding workarounds, of skipping the first step and coming back to it later.</p><br />\n<p>As someone who writes a lot about startups, steeped in press releases about seed funding and the necessity of more capital, this is refreshing. Thankyou is a brand selling physical products, unlike someone purveying digital goods, the barriers to entry for Thankyou have been very high, but they always found a way. Thankyou was constantly validating, having to prove themselves. They are a far better organisation for it.</p><br />\n<p>It also makes me think of older aid organisations, how mountains of cash and a place in the establishment can slowly rot away an institution with even the best of intentions. Incentives become misaligned, becoming more about perpetuation than the original goal. Cash is so bountiful that strategy and an emphasis on ROI melts away. Just think of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pro Publica’s stunning 2015 investigation into the Red Cross</a> &#8211; how they raised half a billion dollars to build just six homes in Haiti.</p><br />\n<p>Anyway, back to Flynn, and he comes up with a great image for the Thankyou method of getting started: letting the cart pull the horse. In this case, referring to the first ever product they launched, where they received an order for 50,000 bottles of water, and a donation of 30,000 bottles, before they had even setup the business or really sorted out a supplier. They then had to go find some money to make it all work. It might not have ever happened had they tried to do it the conventional way &#8211; have a great idea and go find someone to fund it.</p><br />\n<blockquote><p><em>“An example of the horse pulling the car would be: find your $20,000 start-up capital, then register the business, and then try and get a distribution deal. But the cart pulling the horse scenario is: land the 50,000 bottle order, then figure out a way to find the $20,000 you need to register and set up the business.”</em></p><br /></blockquote>\n<p>Thankyou are currently selling Chapter One with a &#8216;pay what you want&#8217; model<a href=\"https://chapterone.thankyou.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> on their website</a>. Another example of constraints leading to creativity &#8211; they are raising money to fund an expansion into New Zealand.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>How did we get to a point where piracy is the default? What drives the millions who consume without paying, without even considering it? How did their tools and methodologies come into being? The answers are varied, often simplistic, largely informed by ideology, experience and financial status.</p><br />\n<p>The most important learning from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525426612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0525426612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=XXFHJTNGAUQ2QM5W\">How Music Got Free by Stephen Witt</a> is that the reality is complex. The tools of the piracy trade were created and diffused for commercial reasons. The very weapons that threaten intellectual property were created because of its incentives. The music industry, like so many that have been thoroughly disrupted, was more focused on protecting its turf than serving customers.</p><br />\n<p>The story of recent music piracy is largely that of the mp3. Much of Witt’s book is a sweeping explanation, from its troublesome birth to its role as a technological enabler – its compression making internet distribution possible, its adoption begetting the vicious circle of iPods, ripping, sharing and networks. One of the biggest names in pirate history – Napster, makes an appearance only briefly, 114 pages into the book.</p><br />\n<p>Until then we are treated to the story of the mp3’s inventors, a team of German engineers, and its investors, the German government and a few corporations. They weren’t trying to create a tool for piracy. Rather, they were trying to fix a very real problem with audio compression. To that end they created a new audio standard, one adopted for countless legitimate uses. But it was also adopted by the pirates – mp3’s allowed for music files a twelfth the size of what had come before, which was essential in a world of dial-up.</p><br />\n<p>This is the hilarious contradiction at the heart of Witt’s history of music piracy; the technology that has arguably done most to make it possible – the mp3, was only created because of the promise of the monopoly rents afforded by intellectual property rights. While the mp3 helped bypass the copyright of musicians and labels, bringing an industry to its knees, its creators walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><br />\n<p>It also doesn’t seem like the actual pirates made much either. Sure, Witt tells the stories of a pirate here, and a syndicate there, who were doing so commercially. But as with many such syndicates on the internet, the driving forces seem to be community, discovery, and the breaking down of technical barriers. Napster wasn’t intended to be commercial, having a weird business model bolted onto it halfway through. Neither were Oink, the Pirate Bay or BitTorrent.</p><br />\n<p>Its where all these pieces fit together that I think the most important point is made – technology, consumers and pirates were all coming together to make a better experience that the industry wanted nothing to do with. The industry wanted to remain in a world of scarcity, forcing users to buy bundles. As the internet began to offer an unlimited selection of music, on demand, the industry dragged its feet and refused to offer a comparable product – the mp3 inventors had pitched a streaming service but were knocked back, Steve Jobs had to fight for the iTunes store.</p><br />\n<p>Yet the consumers obviously demanded such a service. Torrent networks have created networks of millions, braving the unknown to listen to what they want when they want. Piracy cut across age groups and demographics, something made evident by the wide variety of people prosecuted by the industry as they sought to protect the old business rather than embrace a new one. It was only after being resoundingly beaten that the industry moved, offering its consumers a comparable experience that they could pay for – Vimeo, Spotify, the iTunes store. And pay for it they have.</p><br />\n<p>I come to this topic, obviously, from a position of sympathy for piracy. When my friends and I were younger – far from being adults, we participated. While our pocket money would only stretch so far for movies and music, I don’t believe this was what drove us. It was selection. Buying a whole album for the the two songs we wanted is ridiculous. Especially with an iPod to fill. And as time has passed, the reduction in piracy has mirrored the availability of media. Why would anyone bother to brave the wild west of torrenting when Spotify, Youtube, Netflix and numerous other services offer such variety and quality at such low prices? There just isn’t any need to do it anymore. If only the music industry had gotten on board sooner.</p><br />\n<p>Title: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525426612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0525426612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=XXFHJTNGAUQ2QM5W\">How Music Got Free</a><br />\nAuthor: Stephen Witt<br />\nPages: 296 (Hardback)</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

I’ve often thought it was the whole point of a biography; to see someone or something that you admire, and want to know how it happened to be. The tales of <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/adam-smith-by-nicholas-phillipson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-first-tycoon-by-tj-stiles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-accidental-billionares-by-ben-mezrich/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> come to mind. But the life of Sam Zemurray, the proverbial fish of this book&#8217;s title, is incredible even without prior knowledge. If not for his stunning role in bringing bananas to all of our diets, or his outsized impact on South America, his story of rags to riches deserves to be told for the other lessons. And one in particular.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;Zemurray&#8217;s life is a parable of the American dream &#8211; not history as recorded in textbooks, but the authentic cask-strength version, a subterranean saga of kickbacks, overthrows, and secret deals: the world as it really works.&#8221;</em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>The story starts with Sam Zemurray, a penniless Russian immigrant, and his discovery of bananas &#8211; posited in numerous fantastical ways. It may sound strange to a modern reader, but bananas weren’t always common, they weren’t destined for smoothies. As a penniless Russian immigrant he had never seen or tasted a banana. And even in the new world, they were hardly a staple. He started small, buying the “waste” bananas of bigger companies, transporting and selling them for a small profit. His bunches became thousands, hundreds of thousands and then millions. Soon there were ships and plantations, railroads and soldiers. He funded a coup and took on the US Government, ran weapons and hired famous mercenaries. Along the way Zemurray and his business grew from something like a fruit-based arbitrage to a vertically integrated behemoth, and he brought the lowly banana along for the ride.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;It was the worldview of the immigrant: understanding how so-called garbage might be valued under a different name, seeing nutrition where others saw only waste.”</em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Reading some of the other reviews of this book, a lot of the emphasis is placed on these, more fantastic aspects of Zemurray’s story. How he once owned most of Guatemala and fantastically took the helm of United Fruit &#8211; the proverbial whale &#8211; in a thrilling boardroom coup. But for me the big lesson is the fundamental aspect of Zemurray’s business: it was built on controlling waste and cost. Nowadays we like to glorify the people who think big and loud, want to fashion their world through grand visions, think Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Zemurray offers a competing path to success, one that is less flashy but also less flash in the pan. He picked the low hanging fruit, literally. His secret sauce wasn’t a new boat that could carry more bananas or carry them faster, it was good old fashioned stinginess.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;Selling hundreds of thousands of bananas a year, he&#8217;d become one of the biggest traffickers in the trade. And he&#8217;d done it without having to incur the traditional costs. His fruit was grown for him, harvested, and shipped for free.&#8221;</em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Seizing the value of ripe fruit is an amazing innovation. It’s what allowed him not only to profit from, but compete with and eventually subsume his competition. The larger, less nimble corporations were not able to recognise what was laying in their laps. And it’s something we can all learn from: most of us don’t have the skills to create a killer app, the nous to build a rocket or the eye to demand design perfection, but we can all take a look around us to see what’s been wasted.

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Speculating about what the future will look like is generally a waste of time. For every correct prediction, you get innumerable Jetsons fantasies. There is, however, a lot to learn from what’s happening right now. Some of the most interesting possibilities thrown up by the information revolution are distributed teams and location agnostic workplaces. Moore’s law and ubiquitous WiFi has given us the power to work from almost anywhere, and at any time. Yet soul-crushing partitions, dreary commutes, and senseless “business hours” rule supreme. Why haven’t companies leaped upon these opportunities? Automattic, the company behind <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">WordPress.com</span></a> and it’s various tentacles, has. Scott Berkun spent a year working for Automattic, and in a Year Without Pants he gives us a fascinating look at why and how it works.</p><br />\n<p>\n </p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;An amazing thing about our digital age is that the person next to you at Starbucks might just be hacking into a Swiss bank or launching multi-warhead nuclear missiles continents away. Or maybe he&#8217;s just on Facebook.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The author, Scott Berkun, was a former Microsoft Employee and has written a great many books that I have been recommended to read (I’m getting there). Hence why he was hired in the first place, hired to help with a mammoth experiment in how Automattic is run, and hired on the condition he could write a book about his experience. So there are a great many excellent points in this book that I could focus on. But there are two that really interest me more than anything else: the possibilities that distributed teams offer, and the culture at Automattic that allows it to work.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Since location is irrelevant, Automattic, the company that runs WordPress.com, can hire the best talent in the world, wherever they are.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Year Without Pants begins with Scott’s team hard at work in the lobby of a hotel in Greece. Two Americans, an Australian and a Brit, meeting in person for only the second time, and yet seamlessly beavering away on an update that would affect millions of people. This one scene illustrates what is possibly the greatest advantage to be found in distributed teams: the talent pool you can draw from is global. If you flick on the news almost anywhere nowadays you are likely to find red-faced businesspeople fuming about a lack of qualified workers, or politicians promising some new scheme to fix the problem (curriculum changes, special visas, incentives, etc.). Automattic get’s to bypass all of this. While Facebook lobbies Congress to keep and hire foreign-born engineers, Automattic hires the best and brightest wherever they happen to be.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;A central element in Automattic culture was results first. Nobody cared when you arrived at work or how long you worked. It didn&#8217;t matter if you were pant-less in your living room or bathing in the sun, swinging in a hammock with a martini in your hand. What mattered was your output. Shouldn&#8217;t the quality of work be the primary measure of worker performance? Isn&#8217;t it good, then, to eliminate traditions that get in the way and add ones that help?&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next point ties right in with the first: a distributed team means a team that crosses ethnicities, languages and timezones. In a globalising world and with an already globalised internet this is a comparative advantage beyond compare. (My own website is run on WordPress but is not hosted by Automattic. So whenever I have a problem I have to wait for someone to be awake and working in Salt Lake City. If you don’t think switching to a service where someone is always on is enticing, well, you’ve got another thing coming). The last great advantage is quality of life for the workers themselves. Automattic employees get to work from home, a Co-Working Space, a coffee shop or pretty much anywhere they feel comfortable and are productive. There are no dress codes, set hours or people looking over their shoulder. And with a relatively flat hierarchy and leadership spread across timezones, the only metric they can really be judged on is their output. For many that mind sound scary, but personally I can’t imagine a more enticing work environment. Let alone one more flexible and conducive to changing lifestyles.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;&#8230;how loaded workplaces are with cultural baggage. We faithfully follow practices we can&#8217;t explain rationally. Why is it that work has to start at 9:00am and end at 5:00pm? Why are you required to wear a tie if you&#8217;re a man and a skirt if you&#8217;re a woman? Why are meetings sixty minutes long by default, and not thirty? We have little evidence these habits produce better work.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All of this, of course, comes down to culture and the nature of the work. They are what make it possible. Automattic is blessed with their product and employees: many Automatticians started out contributing to WordPress as a hobby, and most if not all believe in it’s ideals of democratising publishing.They are also all creative: building and fixing a platform that powers twenty percent of the internet. The same can’t be said of most businesses. But the leadership of Automattic also seem to go to extraordinary lengths to be transparent, empower their team (read: treat them like adults), foster a community, find the right people, and act like people not robots. The stories Berkun relates of their hiring practices (such as project based rather than interview based evaluations) and parties and getaways gives you the impression of a company that realises culture is important, and tries very hard to get it right. Really, the numerous tangents Berkun goes on about culture are worth the sticker price on their own. And the fact that Automattic endorses a book that includes anecdotes of company drinking parties and senior employees taking part in evaluations while hung over, just drives it all home.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;&#8230;remote work, and many other perks Automattic used, will work or fail because of company culture, not because of the perk itself…Every benefit granted can be used to perform better work, or it can be abused. The benefit itself rarely has much to do with it.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I came to this book while researching a radio series I am doing on the opportunities facing Australia’s nascent tech sector (Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic, very politely declined my interview request). I feel I have learned so much more from this book, and from Automattic, than I ever imagined at the outset. I’m not going to say their model is the future of work. As with any human endeavour, the workplaces of the future will be so myriad and diverse as to escape encapulsation. But there is so much here for the rest of us to learn from, and even implement, that we cannot ignore it. The Year Without Pants is more than a well written account of a unique working experience. It is a guide for how to create and manage a company that rides the biggest workplace innovation in generations, as well as a taste of what’s to come.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;The most dangerous tradition we hold about work is that it must be serious and meaningless. We believe that we&#8217;re paid money to compensate us for work not worthwhile on its own.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A couple of hours ago I did something amazing: bought lunch. I walked about a kilometre down the road, straight into my favourite Thai restaurant, and got myself some fried rice. Now, you’re probably questioning my sanity, or at the very least pondering how amazing my story is. But it is amazing. In exchange for a colourful piece of paper, the wonderful lady behind the counter put down her newspaper, and through a mixture of skill and fresh ingredients made me a tasty meal. How did it get that way? Why does a piece of paper imbue sufficient power to drive human action? This, my friend, is the story of money. It’s the story of innovation. And it’s an incredibly fascinating story.</p><br />\n<p>\n </p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Credit and debt, in short, are among the essential building blocks of economic development, as vital to creating the wealth of nations as mining, manufacturing or mobile telephony.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Where to begin? Written on the cusp of the Global Financial Crisis, Niall Ferguson starts his tale with a rumination on what exactly money is — silver, paper, pixels on a screen. The root of all evil, the cause of our discontent, and the key to our success. Money is and has been all of these things. But these are not what make money, well, money. Money is a unit of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. These are the real essences of money, not the whiff of Gold or the declaration of a sovereign. And it’s the story of money’s transformation through all of these stages, to hit all these targets, that makes up the bulk of the pages.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;From ancient Mesopotamia to present-day China, in short, the ascent of money has been one of the driving forces behind human progress: a complex process of innovation, intermediation and integration that has been as vital as the advance of science or the spread of law in mankind&#8217;s escape from the drudgery of subsistence agriculture and the misery of the Malthusian trap.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The most interesting component of the book, however, are the ancillary tales of these great leaps. The clay tablets from 2000BC Mesopotamia, which turn out to be a form tradable debt — thousands of years before the first bond markets. The Spanish looting of an Incan civilisation thoroughly unaware silver’s status in the West, and the long term affects on Spanish Competitiveness. The rise of the Stockmarket in Amsterdam, which fuelled the long arm of the East India Companies. The spread of the “Cotton Bond” allowing the American South to stick around in a war with the North. The Scottish Clergymen who started an Insurance fund that invested the proceeds and paid the widowers and children of clergy out of the profits. And, finally, collateralised debt obligations, sub prime mortgages and the Global Financial Crisis.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;When we withdraw banknotes from automated telling machines, or invest portions of our monthly salaries in bonds and stocks, or insure our cars, or remortgage our homes, or renounce home bias in favour of emerging markets, we are entering into transactions with many historical antecedents.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s with that last point that Ferguson really strikes home. The final parts of the book deal with the complexity of the modern financial system, and how it unravelled in the period leading up to publication. For while all these great innovations have built the world we now inhabit, they have also created one so complex that many simply give up. But we can&#8217;t. Giving up is what allows the likes of sub-prime loans to promulgate, and myriad mistakes be remade. Ferguson’s book is a partial answer to that. It’s nowhere near the silver bullet — for more sophisticated readers, there is much to be desired (Adam Smith seems to be particularly glossed over, for example), but it’s a great overview. And Ferguson’s passion for anecdote makes it particularly enjoyable. Three out of five.</span></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

I would hear of Muhammad’s return to Mecca, his clearing the Kabah of pagan idols, and his fight for social justice and the empowerment of Women. It’s a version of Muhammad I can understand. It fits my family.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The history of a religious tradition is a continuous dialogue between a transcendent reality and current events in the mundane sphere.”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But this image has become muddled. It’s clear that there are many visions of who Muhammad was and what he means. Much of my life has taken place against the backdrop of a cosmic war — planes flying into buildings, invasions, car bombs and police raids. And Muhammad has been invoked, repeatedly, by all sides. Used to justify all manner of atrocities. This tension has become especially meaningful in the past few months, as gunmen attempt to police his image on our own doorsteps.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“We have a long history of Islamophobia in Western culture that dates back to the time of the Crusades. In the twelfth century, Christian monks in Europe insisted that Islam was a violent religion of the sword, and that Muhammad was a charlatan who imposed his religion on a reluctant world by force of arms; they called him a lecher and asexual pervert.”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, who was Muhammad? The benevolent and merciful figure that I’ve grown up with? The man who inspires the billion plus Muslims who go about their days peaceably, who we never hear from? Or was he the great Muslim crusader that the Islamic Fundamentalists tout? How about the bloodthirsty tyrant that many of his obstreperous critics claim? As the cosmic war of the past decade is joined by a culture war, increasingly on our own doorsteps, this is a question that needs answering. And so, I turned to Karen Armstrong.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The work of Muhammad’s first biographers would probably not satisfy a modern historian. They were men of their time and often included stories of a miraculous and legendary nature that we would interpret differently today.”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Muhammad has had many biographers, the first emerging a hundred or so years after his death. However, like many other religious figures, the bulk of our knowledge comes from the scriptures, which in turn rely on an oral history. Armstrong begins the story with Muhammad’s first revelation, when he was forty years old. But she quickly backtracks and takes us through the religious, cultural and economic context of Muhammad’s time. Aspects of his life that are inseparable from his teachings and legacy, but are rarely mentioned now. We learn about his birth into the Hashim clan in Mecca, an important clan in a powerful city. His marriage to Khadijah in his twenties Khadijah was employer and a rich widow with whom he would remain monogamous (not the norm) until her death. And as the short 200-odd pages go by, we follow the slow creation of Islam, the Muslim exile to Medina and their struggle to return. All set in the context of the wider Arabian world that both influenced and was influenced by them.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Muhammad literally sweated with the effort to bring peace to war-torn Arabia, and we need people who are prepared to do this today. His life was a tireless campaign against greed, injustice, and arrogance. He realised that Arabia was a turning point and that the old way of thinking would no longer suffice, so he wore himself out in the creative effort to evolve an entirely new solution.”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This focus on context is brilliant. After all, Muhammad’s tale is like many other stories from pre-modernity &#8211; awful when the context is removed. However, there are also weaknesses with Armstrong’s account. The most obvious is that it is entirely uncritical. Apart from a brief mention at the beginning, there is scarce reference to the fact that the entire story is built upon an oral history of Muhammad’s followers. And yet, it is also written with absolute certainty. There are no questions given to the possibility of bad memory, an incomplete historical record, or alteration through retelling. This problem is especially clear when Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s reputation for honesty and grace &#8211; it may be so, but his followers would say that wouldn&#8217;t they? And since the scriptures are God’s revelations channeled through Muhammad, from where does this survey of his contemporaries emanate? Even worse, such hagiographic characterisations are often accompanied by literary flourishes and insights into the Prophet’s own mind &#8211; what are the sources for these intrusions? I would greatly love to read the tome in which his every sigh and facial expression are also recorded.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The Qur’an is the holy word of God, and it’s authority remains absolute. But Muslims know that it is not always easy to interpret. Its laws were designed for a small community…”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don’t mind a critical account, there is another big issue &#8211; the question of Muhammad’s agency. The context-centric approach means that most of the events are portrayed as a reaction to external cultural and political events. For example; the rival Quraysh clan does something, and suddenly Muhammad is gifted the perfect revelation and strategy. What comes off is both a God and Prophet in thrall to outside events, responding to the world rather than shaping it. Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s disdain for metaphysics, but should we come away with such an emphasis on politics? A cynical reading could conclude that Muhammad doesn’t have agency, and that many of these revelations are quite convenient. Is that the intention? If so, who exactly is the target audience of this account?</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“If we are to avoid catastrophe, the Muslim and Western worlds must learn not merely to tolerate but to appreciate one another. A good place to start is with the figure of Muhammad: a complex man, who resists facile, ideologically-driven categorisation, who sometimes did things that were difficult or impossible for us to accept, but who had profound genius and founded a religion and cultural tradition that was not based on the sword but whose name — “Islam” — signified peace and reconciliation.”</i></span></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To answer my conundrum from earlier, Armstrong paints a picture of Muhammad quite close to the one I was brought up with. Only much richer than my family could ever manage. He wasn&#8217;t the man claimed by the fundamentalists on either side, but a man of his time. The context she provides is eye opening, and definitely an important addition to our current debate. But Armstrong&#8217;s lack of criticism is really the takeaway. It invalidates it for anyone who wants as “true” a picture as possible. Granted, in our current climate it is understandable why Armstrong could not do for Muhammad what <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/zealot-by-reza-aslan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reza Aslan did for Jesus</a>, but Muhammad already has enough hagiographies. Muhammad by Karen Armstrong is the best biography I have found so far. So, for now at least, I will recommended it. But I’m going to keep looking for a more definitive biography.</span></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Title: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061155772/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061155772&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=MCNUYLU5KJFXULUK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muhammad &#8211; Prophet For Our Time</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Author: Karen Armstrong</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pages: 249 (Paperback)</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Josh’s Rating: 2/5</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon Link: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061155772/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061155772&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=MCNUYLU5KJFXULUK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muhammad &#8211; Prophet For Our Time</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Facebook has become all-pervasive. It screams at me from the laptops of my fellow classmates, tracks me as I traverse the interwebs, draws visitors to my blog and radio show, and invades the real world through my vibrating phone. The draw of its network and the push of it’s firehose has become inexorably linked with the internet itself. However, like many, I ache to escape its grasp. I have all but shut down my profile, installed blockers on everything but my cat, and rarely log on. But perhaps what I want more is to figure it out. And so I found myself opening ‘The Accidental Billionaires’ by Ben Mezrich. You might know it as the basis of ‘The Social Network,&#8217; which was a surprisingly faithful and brilliant adaptation. It is one of the most entertaining business book I have ever read. That isn’t a compliment.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Nonfictionish” is how I have seen it described in a couple of places. And, really, I can think of no better descriptor. The Accidental Billionaires is a business book written like a novel. Or, as Mezrich put’s it in the introduction; <em>“a dramatic, narrative account based on dozens of interviews, hundreds of sources, and thousands of pages of documents…”</em>. Now, having read that, I was expecting something along the lines of a Michael Lewis or Malcolm Gladwell tale — a high concept told narratively to keep us plebs interested. Unfortunately Mezrich does not seem to have the deft touch of Lewis or Gladwell, as it’s the drama that wins out over everything else.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From the start, the booze-fueled parties, super-speculative points of view, and bizarre literary flourishes build mountains of melodrama and scant understanding. I really am unsure what insights should be gleamed from Mark Zuckerberg lost in his reflection in a computer screen, Eduardo Saverin &#8211; our hapless foil — wondering if he ever really knew Zuckerberg, or the virtuous Winklevoss twins fighting for justice in an otherwise cruel campus. The tension between Zuckerberg, Saverin and the Winklevi does well to build tension throughout, but the space needed detracts from everything else. The real meat of Facebook’s genesis and rise is lost amid the kind of superficial account you&#8217;d get from a blowhard at a party. I went in wanting to learn about Facebook, but I’ve come out not quite sure if I learned anything at all. Really, upon reflection it seems like Aaron Sorkin may have toned the book down a bit. I don’t remember the movie being as soapy.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Perhaps this is a Facebook book for a Facebook world. Screaming for attention by airing what was once hidden — the sex, drugs and lawsuits. Hiding the message under layers of drama so we don’t even know we’ve learned something — like putting your pet’s medicine in a treat. If all you want is a passing understanding of Facebook, maybe this is the book for you. The Facebook story is in there, superficially at least. But if you want to know more, about it’s conquering of college campuses and burst into the mainstream, about its rise into a genuine business and global powerhouse. If you are looking for lessons, if you want to understand what drives the pokes, look elsewhere. Two stars.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\">\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Title: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307740986/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307740986&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=W5CV234CB7WNK6WE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Accidental Billionaires</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Author: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ben-Mezrich/e/B001H6OGU6/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=4Z7ZLQ2BFRIMOTVZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Mezrich</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pages: 272 (Paperback)</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Josh’s Rating: 2/5</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon Link: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307740986/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307740986&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=W5CV234CB7WNK6WE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Accidental Billionaires</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Like a lot of people, I was absolutely entranced by this year’s remake of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos. It wasn&#8217;t just the stunning visuals and mind-blowing science, it was the stories of the people who have carried us this far. The giants upon whose shoulders we now stand. Michael Faraday, William Herschel, Joseph von Fraunhofer, Cecilia Payne, Edmond Halley, and, of course, Isaac Newton (to name a few). Cosmos made them all come alive, and gave me a thirst to know more about them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the series will be continued. So, for anyone like me, its time to hit the books. Let’s begin with the man who laid the foundation of the modern world &#8211; Isaac Newton.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;He was born into a world of darkness, obscurity, and magic; led a strangely pure and obsessive life, lacking parents, lovers, and friends; quarrelled bitterly with great men who crossed his path; veered at least once to the brink of madness; cloaked his work in secrecy; and yet discovered more of the essential core of human knowledge than anyone before or after.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Isaac Newton is a peculiar figure. Anyone who has received any semblance of a liberal education can probably name him and some of his achievements. You may even be able to recall his pointed nose and luscious hair. But what do we know beyond that? Where was he born? How did he work? What drove him? This is where James Gleick steps in. Many of you may know of Gleick. He’s a prominent science writer, with several other great books out there (a review of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400096235/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400096235&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=WJ6W55WGRAF7MDIH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Information</a> is forthcoming). But the deftness with which he brings science to the less erudite is really on show with this biography. It’s not a long book, more of a Newton summary really, but it hits the high points. It begins with a visit to Woolsthorpe &#8211; where Newton was born, works through his education and scientific awakening, and finishes with Newton’s legacy. That last subject being something that could fill whole libraries.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;What Newton learned remains the essence of what we know, as if by our own intuition&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For a small book — my edition comes in at under two hundred pages — there is an incredible amount to be gleaned about the life of Isaac Newton. How many of us really consider Isaac Newton the ostensible orphan? When school children learn about his theories in science textbooks, do we realise how hard up the young Newton was for simple paper and pens, let alone textbooks? When we imagine him sitting under the Apple tree (surely a myth), do we conjure the ways the young Newton really did turn the natural world into a veritable laboratory? How many of us imagine a man famous for calculating his way through the mysterious of the cosmos, also filling notebooks with the ingredients for paint, the Bible&#8217;s hidden codes, and lists of thousands of nouns in different languages (etc.)? His forays into alchemy and other scorned fields are legendary, but did you know Newton had to be goaded into publishing his legitimate work? Even his famous Principia? Textbooks and popular imagination give us an image of Newton as a robot genius. But Gleick reveals him to be so much more. An irascible yet modest man, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge changed the world.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“It was nature’s destiny now to be mathematised. Henceforth space would have dimension and measure; the moon would be subject to geometry.”</span></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Newton’s life is fascinating, and, as all good biographers do, Gleick has revealed his subject to be much more than our cartoonish popular conception. The book is well written, really, I demolished it in a day. But it’s arguable how much this is due to it’s readability as to it’s length. And it’s the length that gets me. Gleick really, manages little more than pulling back the curtain on a giant of the modern age. And when you consider how much context he must provide — on the age of Enlightenment, the wars with Hooke and Leibniz over no less than Gravity and Calculus (etc.) — it’s no wonder we emerge on the other end having barely touched his personality or character. Newton was a revolutionary, his shadow still falls over science, economics, mathematics, philosophy, theology, and much, much more. As a short dip into his life and works, Gleick’s book is more than sufficient. As a study of one of the most influential men in history, it leaves a lot to be desired.</span></p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“No one feels the burden of Newton’s legacy, looming forward from the past, more than the modern scientist. A worry nags at his descendants: that Newton may have been too successful; that the power of his methods gave them too much authority.”</span></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Title: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032954/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400032954&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=WU6LXZFPN6JMW4S4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Isaac Newton</a></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Author: James Gleick</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pages: 191 (Paperback)</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Josh’s Rating: 3/5</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon Link: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032954/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400032954&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=WU6LXZFPN6JMW4S4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Isaac Newton</a></span></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Adam Smith is one of those figures that flits in the background of modern life. His work impacts us all, but how many know his name? His profile adorns the textbooks of eager university students, but ask them what he contributed. Even amongst those who know of Smith and his work, who can tell us what inspired and shaped him? What twigged that led him to become the prime mover of modern economics? The stories of comparable men in other fields &#8211; Aristotle and biology, Galileo and astronomy, Humbolt and geography; are common knowledge. Their fame and name so dwarf their contemporaries that they all but stand alone in our imaginations. Adam Smith has no such legend. Nevertheless, the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8313636-adam-smith?ac=1&#038;from_search=true\">story of his quest for a theory of everything</a> deserves to be told.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;The Wealth of Nations is the greatest and most enduring monument to the intellectual culture of the Scottish Enlightenment. It contains a theory about the behaviour of human beings when they are seen through the lens of Scottish politeness, about agents who are deeply committed to the improvement of mind, manners and property, and are able to believe that in following what seems to be the path of nature they are acting in a way that will serve the public good.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, Adam Smith did not leave a paper trail. He lived with his mother for most of his life, wasn’t much of a correspondent and forced his friends to destroy his personal papers. Really, if it weren’t for David Hume, his few loyal students and his published work, we wouldn’t be left with anything at all. As a result, ideas are all that survive of Smith, and the narrative Phillipson has managed to piece together is entirely an intellectual one. The source material for the tale Phillipson tells is the world that surrounded Smith. Through the courses he took at Glasgow and Oxford, and the notes of his own students, we see a man indebted to Classical Philosophy and Rhetoric. From his friendship with Hume and the set with which he roamed, we find a tireless intellect. And out of his lectures and books we see a theorist drawing from all that surrounded him — from the coffers of Scottish merchants, to the work habits of Oxford dons and the writings of French academics — in the quest to develop a theory of everything.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Rousseau once famously remarked that while men were born free, everywhere they were in chains. In Smith&#8217;s view the chains were those of the imagination, chains could be loosened by a common sense, sceptical awareness of the processes by which the moral personality was formed, but never altogether thrown off.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although what we end up with is a jagged silhouette in the middle of a busy canvas — as Phillipson is able to paint around the subject but little more, perhaps the reader is not the worse for wear. The key points of any good biography are more than met. We are introduced to the world in which Smith lived; where Western Philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment were in full bloom. We encounter both that which inspired Smith, and the full cohort that he in turn inspired. We meet his contemporaries, and accompany him on the better-documented journeys in his later life. All without the emotional baggage of your average biography. I am almost of a mind to thank Smith for removing his personal details from the occasion, it’s much cleaner this way. If you are someone who really wants to learn and benefit from Smith’s intellectual journey, and can stand a rigorous biography, this book is definitely recommended. Maybe if more read this book Smith wouldn’t be flitting in the background.</span></p><br />\n<p>&lt;</p><br />\n<p>p class=&#8221;p3&#8243; style=&#8221;text-align: center;&#8221;><em><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;For in the last resort, the Wealth of Nations, like the Theory of Moral Sentiments and the lectures on which it drew, was a call to his contemporaries to take moral, political and intellectual control of their lives and the lives of those for whom they were responsible. It is in such contexts that the Wealth of Nations needs to be read by historians. The rest can be left to his disciples and critics.&#8221;</span></em></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As we delve further into the twenty-first century, the BRIC and MINT countries are converging with those that have sat atop the heap for so long. They are leaving many nations and billions of people behind. But why is this so? Why did the industrial revolution kick off in England and take only select countries with it? Why were Japan and South Korea able to leave their region in the dust during the twentieth century, and how has Nigeria recently stormed past it’s neighbours? Why is China now set to become king of the mountain, not so long after Mao dragged it to such drastic lows? Why are some countries poor while others prosperous, some successful while others not, and why do these fortunes ebb and flow? In short, what is the magic ingredient? There are many books out there with a claim to answer. Their theories range from the geographic to the cultural. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have yet another to add to the pile; for them, the secret sauce is creative destruction. And the differences between success or failure is the presence or absence of institutions that foster it.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“Countries differ in their economic success because of their different institutions, the rules influencing how the economy works, and the incentives that motivate people.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Creative Destruction is an idea popularised by the economist Joseph Schumpeter to refer to a process of incessant industrial revolution, of innovations pushing out the antiquated. It is records making way for cassettes, CD’s bowing before Mp3 players. Why Nations Fail is built on the premise that this innovation, this creative destruction, is a necessary ingredient in the success of a country. And further, for a nation to harness creative destruction requires a certain amount of freedom, transparency and protection for it&#8217;s citizens. According to Acemoglu and Robinson, these are features of society that are granted or restricted by it’s institutions. So-called “inclusive institutions” are markets, laws and norms that protect and incentivise innovation and productivity. They foster creative destruction and are the building blocks of a successful society. On the other hand, “extractive institutions” are ones that protect and enrich the elite, that dis-incentivise productivity and innovation. They hinder creative destruction and are a recipe for a failed nation. </span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“The fear of creative destruction is the main reason why there was no sustained increase in living standards between the Neolithic and Industrial revolutions. Technological innovation makes human societies prosperous, but also involves the replacement of the old with the new, and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of certain people.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Viewing the world through this prism gives Acemoglu and Robinson an explanation for where we are, and where we are going. The countries that today enjoy a high standard of living are those that have established multi-party democracies, transparency and protection through the rule of law and independent judiciaries, and incentives through free markets and patents (etc). On the other hand, countries that have seen dictatorships and despots, entrenched elites, disruptive monopolies and subsidies, and few political rights; have failed, are in the process of failing, or will soon do so. Acemoglu and Robinson explain that the Industrial Revolution kicked off in Britain because the citizens had already achieved hard won restrictions on the elite. Power was distributed and new protections in areas such as patents rewarded innovation and productivity. Pioneers like James Watt &#8211; famous for his steam engine — were not shut out by a rent-seeking aristocracy. Further, the efforts of these pioneers to secure their gains ensured a virtuous cycle, a promulgation of new institutions to further codify gains. According to Acemoglu and Robison, Britain hosted the Industrial Revolution because it’s inclusive institutions had already made way for the mother of creative destruction, and creative destruction begat even more creative destruction.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the United States is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite.” </span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The authors use compelling examples and “experiments” to back up their claims — most notably, the difference between Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora; a city that straddles the border between the United States and Mexico. This one city provides a seemingly perfect “natural experiment” of the institution thesis; as geography, culture, and ethnicity are the same on both sides of the fence. Arguably, it is only recent history, which has resulted in differing institutions, that have caused the diverging living standards for the two Nogales. But there is more. Other examples trotted up by the authors include East and West Germany, Spanish South America &#8211; where the indigenous population were exploited to cash in on an abundance of natural resources, and English North America &#8211; where a scant aboriginal population and minimal natural resources forced the English to transplant and incentivise a European population. West Germany is still footing the bill for the shambles that was East Germany. The inhabitants of Spanish South America were turned into chattel, while the new inhabitants of North America progressed and built institutions to protect their growing status. More examples come in the analysis of East and Western Europe &#8211; where Western Europe had largely managed to reign in their monarchs and elites, much of Eastern Europe carried the burdens of Serfdom and Feudalism well into the twentieth century. While industry promulgated in the West, Eastern Lords bound their subjects and continued personally profitable agrarian economies. Most compelling for me was an exploration of Australia &#8211; where a scarcity of labour similar to North America forced the English to incentivise immigrants. The Convicts and settlers went on to build institutions to secure what they had gains in a similar fashion to their brothers elsewhere, institutions that are the foundations of modern Australia. Through numerous examples, Acemoglu and Robinson show that the countries that have succeeded have done so by following an economic ideal of productivity and innovation over monopoly and rent seeking, and they have done so not out of economic rationality, but political necessity.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“World inequality today exists because during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some nations were able to take advantage of the industrial revolution and the technologies and methods of organization that it brought while others were unable to do so”</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why Nations Fail is a book that kicked up a storm of debate in the academic and development communities. The reviews written by the authors of other theories are enlightening, as are the responses of Acemoglu and Robinson. However, there are also major flaws in this work. One look at the book jacket, at those who have lent their names to promote it, raises questions. They are a remarkably homogenous bunch. People like Niall Ferguson &#8211; who even utilises some similar examples in his book, Civilisation. And, I’ll be honest, I tore through this book, loving it the entire way. It’s message appealed to me. But of course people like Niall Ferguson and myself love it. It offers a theory that takes a very Eurocentric view of the world, and then works backwards. Democracy and much of the social and political norms cherished in the West are taken as given and as ideal, and then ascribed major roles in past success. Niall Ferguson, myself, and everyone else on that jacket have a natural predilection to this theory. Our innate biases are towards the institutions that have allowed us to prosper and thrive in our wonderful, Western societies. But can liberalism really be the only path to success? The cloud overhanging all of this is the lack of real explanation of what’s going on in places like China &#8211; a nation ravaged by extractive institutions if there ever was one, yet with an economy growing pell mell and a massive savings rate. If anything, success is simply too complicated for such a grand unified theory. However, and whether you agree with their theory or not, Acemoglu and Robinson have produced a fantastic book. A great read. This is one of those library books that I really wish I had bought. From the moment I started reading it, I have wanted to share it with all and sundry. I have my doubts, but I highly recommend it. At the very least it will provoke debate and introspection.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">“Nations fail today because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate.”</span></em></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

Their preoccupation with celebrities, disasters, scandals, crime, the political horserace, and other such pabulum and infotainment. But Thomas E. Patterson also deplores the state of democracy, and views the two as inextricably linked. Just as ninety years ago Walter Lippmann warned the “crisis in Western Democracy is a crisis in journalism,” Patterson has sought to highlight the deficiencies in modern journalism, how it is affecting our ability to self-govern, and has offered an antidote; knowledge-based journalism.</p><br />\n<p></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>&#8220;It is a short step from misinformation to mischief, as we have seen repeatedly in recent policy.&#8221;</i></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Around the world, studies measuring trust and satisfaction consistently put journalists at the bottom of professions. Even below politicians. All the while, the traditional mass media lose audience to the purveyors of satire, punditry and hackery. The financial issues facing the journalism industry are well documented, but as Patterson points out throughout the book, there is a deeper crisis facing the profession. Journalism has become dumbed down. Even name-brand journalism schools have structured their courses to more resemble trade schools than instructors of a vital component in a functioning democracy. Journalists increasingly have little experience or knowledge in the subjects that they cover. While technical expertise may be exemplary, content expertise is often lacking.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>&#8220;It is nearly impossible to have sensible public deliberation when large numbers of people are out of touch with reality.&#8221;</i></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an age of tight deadlines and slimmed down newsrooms, this is a disaster for creating an informed public. Serious policy is overlooked while much simpler — for the journalist as well as the consumer — political hackery is played up. Minor but easy to understand developments — such as interest and inflation blips — are held under the microscope, while the larger picture — the state of the business cycle for example — is all but lost. Powerful figures — such as those who pushed for the invasion of Iraq &#8211; are left unchecked by those ill equipped to do so. All the while, journalists must rely ever more on outsiders to do fundamental aspects of their jobs — providing context and scrutiny in a world bursting with information. Studies show that the public are consistently misinformed on a variety of important subjects, and, as Patterson points out, many of these subjects bear a startling correlation to the innate biases of a profession that is chasing its audience and has lost sight of its intellectual rigour. Is there any doubt of the cumulative effect?</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>&#8220;Informed citizens do not spring forth from birth. The process of informing the public is an ongoing task”</i></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Patterson, the answer to both conundrums is the injection of “knowledge” back into journalism. Specifically, the “knowledge of how to use knowledge”. Obviously, the variety of subjects that any one journalist will encounter during a career is too much to become intimate with all of it. But similar can be said of a teacher. So, like teachers, Patterson suggests that journalists be trained in the fundamentals of what they need — history, analytical thinking, ethics, data analysis , etc. But also like teachers, they should be trained in communicating across these subjects. Providing context and other information in order that the audience can “make sense of the events”. According to Patterson, this “content knowledge” would take journalism a step closer to fulfilling its duty to democracy, all the while distancing it from the innumerable hacks who operate on the internet for free. Knowledge, Patterson claims, is the solution to more than one of the problems that plagues journalism.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>&#8220;Knowledge is the starting point as well as the end product of systematic inquiry, guiding the practitioner in what to look for as well as what to make of what is found.”</i></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a citizen, an avid news consumer, and someone who spends considerable time in a newsroom every week, Pattersons&#8217; book rings horribly true on many levels. The lack of socially beneficial news and a common set of facts, as well as the incursion of infotainment into the “bible of democracy” has undoubtedly harmed the public square. I would be glad to see more informed voices take the stage. But I am sceptical that there is a place for such a development. Recent election coverage in Australia and America was abysmal, topped only by the bush-league reporting of the actual governance after the spectacle. But it is this, along with the blow-by-blow accounts of everything royal and celebrity, beat-ups and other fluff; that really pulls in the ratings. Look at what actually gets shared on social media. Its cat pictures and Upworthy, not the Washington Post or the Financial Times. Patternsons’ book gives a great account of much of what ails the news media. I’m not so sure how much demand there is for his cure.</span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Journalists are in the daily business of making the unseen visible, of connecting us to the world beyond our direct experience.”</i></span></p><br />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Even now, more than a hundred and thirty years after his death, it’s pretty hard to escape the shadow of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Along with the likes of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan, he was instrumental in the creation of our modern world. They kicked off the era of the mega-corporation and titans of industry, of the worship of laissez-faire and self-made men. They so dominated their age that even now, reading almost any newspaper, you can still see the fear these robber barons stirred. But if anything, Stiles’ account of Vanderbilt only makes him rise in my estimation. He wasn’t just the richest man of his age. He wasn’t just the railroad king with the killer sideburns. He was the 19th century’s Richard Branson. He was batman.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p>The story starts on Staten Island, where an entrepreneurial family instilled Vanderbilt with many of the skills and qualities that would lead to his total domination of the American economy. He wasn’t educated — he left school at the age of 11, and many of Stiles’ quotes betray a command of spelling and grammar that would embarrass a modern 11 year old. By sixteen he was already a skilled sailor and wheeler-dealer, by twenty he was ferrying goods and people along the cost, and only a couple of years later he was riding the crest of the Steam Revolution with Edward Gibbons.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p>What follows is several hundred pages tracking Vanderbilt’s rise through the echelons of the business and social world. First smashing the syndicates that monopolised shipping around New York, then pioneering new lines up and down the coast, and even riding the rapids through Nicaragua to the West Coast of America &#8211; to capitalise on the Gold Rush. Along the way Vanderbilt encountered entrenched interests, traitors, legalised monopolies, and even the American Civil War. He waged battle after battle (and not just financial), slashing fares and costs, and engaging in the short-selling and cornering that marked the new battlefield — the stock exchange. Eventually we wind up with Vanderbilt in the role most of us know him as: railroad king. A role that would see him build New York’s Grand Central Station and personally oversee/fund the construction of infrastructure that would shame the South and much of Europe. In all, we follow Vanderbilt from captain of a small skiff to his station as the first tycoon — a man whose wealth would have counted for $1 out of every $9 in circulation.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p>This is the book that any proponent of unfettered capitalism should be forced to read. But it also masterfully illustrates the shortsightedness of decentralisation, cronyism and over/needless regulation. It is hard to read of the syndicates, monopolies, vulture capitalism, lobbying, battles and dominance, and not wonder how this benefited the average consumer and citizen. But the regulatory and societal norms that Vanderbilt had to push through, also make you wonder what more he could have accomplished, and what others were left behind. Stiles has managed to write a book that both serves its purpose as a historical account, and provides commentary on our present. About the only complaint I can muster is that after a while the names and dates were just too much to follow — but this is no complaint at all. It is a brilliantly written — dare I say swashbuckling — story. The subtitle “Epic life of Cornelius Vanderbilt” doesn’t capture the half of it. Four out of five.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Power of Place is not an abstract concept. It’s all around us. It’s the reason why my German cousins have a life expectancy 7 years longer than my Sri Lankan cousins. It’s why I breeze through customs in most countries with my British passport, while my highly esteemed Grandpa has to jump through hoops with his Sri Lankan one. And it has resulted in thousands of Asylum Seekers languishing in detention on Nauru and Manus Island, caught in limbo while trying to reach the freedom and affluence that many Australians take for granted. As the political world pivots towards inequality as a legitimate issue for debate and action, more focus needs to be placed on the role birthplace plays in opportunity. The Power of Place, through its influence on mother tongue, movement, religion, education, health, natural environment, natural resources, cultural norms, and many other factors that de Blij explores; “remains the most potent factor shaping the destinies of billions”.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“The power of place manifests itself in continua of opportunity and risk, advantage and privation.”</em></strong></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>From the outset, de Blij sets his work in contrast to the likes of Thomas Friedman, those who claim the world is ‘flattening’ &#8211; that forces like globalisation are creating a world of equal opportunity. As de Blij points out, this is true for only a small minority of the world’s population &#8211; less than three percent of the world’s population reside in a country other than that of their birth. Only 15% of the world’s population live in the “global core”, while controlling more than 75% of income. The other 75%, those who live in the ‘periphery’ and control just 25% of income, can we really say they have equal opportunity? The 97% of those who still live in the same place as their fathers and grandfathers were born, can we say they have the same opportunity as the 3% lucky enough to follow the action? Only someone living under a rock would think that there is equal opportunity throughout the world. And only if there is freedom of movement, freedom to reach what little places do offer greater opportunity, could there possibly be any flattening. More so, migration even within some countries &#8211; China and North Korea for example &#8211; is tightly controlled. This means that for the vast majority of the world their destiny is inextricably intwined with the destiny of their place of birth. And even those fortunate enough to be born into developed countries &#8211; countries where there is ostensibly more opportunity, &#8211; they may not have had the fortune of being born in the right place within them. For example, children who are born in San Francisco have access to better public schools than those born in Minnesota, while literacy rates and healthcare access in rural (especially Aboriginal) communities in Australia are appalling compared to those in the major cities.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>“The power of place defines an aggregate of circumstances and conditions ranging from cultural traditions to natural phenomena, into which we are born, with which we cope, and from which we derive our own multiple identities.”</strong></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>In contrast to the proponents of a flat world, de Blij defines three types of people; mobals, locals and globals. The overwhelming majority of the world are ‘Locals’ &#8211; the “poorest” and “least mobile”, the 97% of the world who are restricted by various factors to live out their lives in their place of birth. The second type are ‘Mobals&#8217; &#8211; migrants, both legal and not, who are both able and willing to cross borders to facilitate better lives. And the third type are ‘Globals’ &#8211; those for whom the world really is flat. Globals are the businessmen and women, government workers and others for whom borders are all but insignificant. But really we must add to this, because even a successful businessman that was born in the wrong country will have trouble with movement and opportunity. It is the juxtaposition of the core and the periphery, the local and the global, the rich and the poor, the obstructed world and the flat, with which much of the book is concerned.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>“With less than 3 percent of the world’s people residing in a country other than that of their birth, it is clear that, for all of migration’s push and pull factors, the overwhelming majority confront the realities of the locale of their parents and grandparents.”</strong></em></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Discussing what it is that restricts 97% of the world moving up the chain from local to global makes up the meat of the book. I touched on many of them in the opening paragraph. It’s things like language — where access to a global language can turn a local into a mobal, while monolingualism (whether forced or not) will undoubtedly curb opportunities for work and movement. Another barrier is being born a woman in the wrong place (de Blij calls Women “the most local of locals”), which immediately brings restrictions on education, movement, healthcare and self determination (etc.) even within countries with resources to burn. And even in what we would consider more enlightened areas, Women still face incredible barriers — domestic violence, unequal wages and glass ceilings etc. Education makes up another barrier, and there isn’t just a dichotomy between those who do and do not receive an education. Even for those who are fortunate enough to be educated not all is rosy — are they receiving the right education? Are they ready for the world of computers, or are they still stuck on the education conveyor-belt established by the Prussians? Religion is the next factor. As de Blij points out, religious differences often drive conflict and nationalism, especially when it comes to the apportioning of divine real estate. It is the Muslim extremists in parts of Pakistan that are throwing up the borders, as are the Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka (etc.), and it is the realms of Christendom and Islam to which a majority of the locals are born, and from which a majority of the mobals originate. I can’t go into all the factors, so I will highlight just one more — the natural world. An abundance of natural resources can be the bane of entrepreneurism through dutch disease, the life support of illiberalism through handouts, the sustenance of civil war, and the cause of policy inertia. A lack of natural resources can mean the difference between studying and fetching water, and the diversion of much needed infrastructure spending to import fossil fuels. Finally, a country that is isolated, landlocked, situated near fault lines, or that is under threat from climate change — like many islands in the pacific for instance — is all but a trap for those born there. Nothing highlights the power of place better than the world’s slipshod distribution of valuable resources, access and natural catastrophes.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“Malaria, perhaps more than any other malady, symbolises the contrasts between global core and periphery when it comes to health.”</em></strong></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>That last paragraph is just a taste of what I have picked up from de Blij’s book. Much of it is obvious, much of it is already covered in daily news reports, but the book’s framing really drives home how important luck is. However, a diagnosis of the situation is really all that de Blij offers. He has equipped me with a multitude of reasons for why the world looks like it does. Why it is so dominated by ‘the Core,&#8217; but the conclusion — entitled “lowering the barriers” — offers very little in guidance on how to fix the problem. It seems to boil down to meeting and altering the local circumstances that trap those that are stuck in the periphery — sexual discrimination, religious indoctrination, monolingualism, poor education, environmental disasters (etc.) — and spreading English and American culture. He even acknowledges that there are already ‘countless programs, projects, schemes, and plans’ already focused on doing just this, but doesn’t take it any further. As such, the book ends on a rather flat note. While I did enjoy reading de Blij’s diagnosis, I am waiting for the prescription.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“It is the globals who build security and migration barriers, not the locals. It is the globals who mobilise armies to intervene in other states, not the locals. It is the globals who move factories from low-wage to even lower-wage environs, wreaking havoc among workers. It is the globals who control the fates of locals as well as mobals, often ruthlessly.”</em></strong></p><br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Bottom Billion is a couple of years old now, and some of the numbers and names are starting to look a little tired. But the debate over the necessity, role, effectiveness, and method of assistance to less developed countries has trudged on in the meantime. What’s more, the popular  media and debate have all but ignored Collier’s jumping off point &#8211; that the incredible rise of the BRICS (among others) has not only masked the lack of development of a billion people that live in other countries, it may even prove a hinderance to their development in the near future. In recent weeks we have seen the <a href=\"http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual Gates Foundation Letter</a> &#8211; which focused on “debunking” the idea that aid doesn&#8217;t work, as well as op-eds by <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/21/the_case_for_aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeffrey Sachs</a>, William Easterly and other prominent academics in the field. But while none of these authors push simplistic for-or-against aid arguments in their books and academic publications, their forays into popular media was quite the opposite. Which brings us to the crowning achievement of Collier’s book &#8211; a comprehensive breakdown (more than we normally see) of the for the lack of development of the bottom billion, and a corresponding argument that our ‘solutions’ need to be just as nuanced.</p><br />\n<p>Collier never explicitly states who the ‘bottom billion’ are, but he begins by defining four ‘traps’ that have caused them to be left behind while other countries race ahead. These are (not in any particular order) <em>conflict</em> &#8211;  which he has found can largely be attributed to poverty and is not simply the cause of it, being <em>landlocked</em> &#8211; countries like Switzerland are exceptional in that they are creative and have access to their neighbours stellar infrastructure and big markets, <em>resource abundance</em> &#8211; an over reliance on primary goods can crowd out other economic activity (also known as dutch disease), and <em>bad governance</em> &#8211; pretty self explanatory. According to Collier all of the countries of the Bottom Billion have fallen into one or more of these traps, and this claim comes with a healthy dose of name dropping from when Collier was at the World Bank, and the minatue of research projects he has done with various assistances.</p><br />\n<p>Such painstaking research and explanation has a couple of benefits. It brings new nuance to the debate about why some countries have been left behind. It’s not, as some would contend, that those that have developed are (necessarily) more willing to work or more productive, or that colonial exploitation is (necessarily) the big bogeyman it is sometimes made out to be. Rather, there are a congruence of individual factors in each situation. As a result, the one-size fits all, easy to sell, ideologically driven fixes are not adequate. In some cases it may only make matters worse &#8211;  for example giving aid money directly to countries with “bad governance” may further entrench corruption. Likewise, free trade alone is unlikely to help a landlocked country. In this situation we may need to spend money ensuring that infrastructure in neighbouring countries is adequate and accessible, we may even need to provide military intervention. This is the most contentious argument that Collier puts forward &#8211; that it is favourable or even necessary for outside powers to provide military intervention. Looking at the problem strictly actuarially, this may make sense. But this is a suggestion that requires a book all of its own, weighing up the positive benefits of military intervention with the world’s recent experience of war &#8211; war weariness, huge expense, and all the complexities of power vacuums (I don’t really see any Germany-esque, decades long occupations in the future).</p><br />\n<p>I am not quite sure how to summarise my thoughts on the book itself. As I have already noted, it adds vital context and detail to a debate often controlled by those eager to ‘save’ the Bottom Billion &#8211; either by coddling them or forcing them to take their medicine. But it is also a tough book to read. It’s only about 200 pages, but it still took me a good week and a half to finish. So easy was it to put down. It often reads like a summary of the authors research, or the famous people he has met or worked with (I count notable academics as famous people). At times he is a little overbearing, up on his high horse looking down at those of us not as academically rigorous as himself. And there is a little too much data and accounts of the minutae of his studies. But the overarching messages are too important. As Collier frequently points out throughout the book, this isn’t an abstract problem. Those of us fortunate enough to live in prosperous societies are not isolated from the Bottom Billion. Their challenges are also our challenges. And we simply need more nuance in this vital debate.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

The title &#8211; sure to boil the blood of any Christian unfamiliar with the wider connotations of the word Zealot, is only driven home by the less than subtle placement of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew on page four  &#8211; “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace, but the sword” (Matthew 1-:34). And of course, to cap it all off, the author is a Muslim. This was the pretence of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWbPpFZ31s#t=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of the most awkward and ridiculous interviews I have ever witnessed</a>. An interview without which many would never have even heard of Zealot or Reza Aslan. But I have been an Aslan fan ever since reading No God but God. And anyone who does make it past the rather ridiculous facade of Zealot will find a book that is clearly written in the same measured tone. It isn’t a hit piece. It is a continuation of much the same ideas that can be found in Aslan’s previous work &#8211; that historical analysis and facts (as best they are) can and should be used in theological contexts.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong>&#8220;This book is an attempt to reclaim, as much as possible, the Jesus of history, the Jesus before Christianity: the politically conscious Jewish revolutionary&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Zealot is marketed as a biography. However, it is like no biography I have ever read. Granted, we must give Aslan some wiggle room due to the nature of his subject; an ancient figure, largely ignored and unknown during his time, and who has been mythologised for close to two thousand years. There are no primary sources of his life, or even his existence (one of the few historians to reference Jesus only mentions him as a clarifying appendage when marking the death of James). Echoing his father’s style, Jesus wasn’t helpful enough to write anything down or otherwise leave anything behind. Aslan, therefore, is forced to source his information mainly from the Christian and Hebrew scriptures. This has many drawbacks &#8211; some aspects of Jesus’s life are skipped over entirely in the scriptures &#8211; or found in some sources and not others, none of the authors knew Jesus personally (they were the scribes in a decades long game of Chinese Whispers) and they have agendas that need to be questioned, and the narratives often contradict each other or independent facts. As a result Aslan has to spend considerable space qualifying almost everything. What follows is a story of Jesus’s life with considerable gaps, is often non-linear, and serves more to educate the reader about the inconsistencies of the source material than the life of Jesus of Nazareth (or Aslan’s particular reading of his life at least). I really wonder why Aslan chose to write in this format rather than directly taking on our sanitised conceptions of Jesus and the Scriptures &#8211; he obviously has all the research to do exactly that.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>&#8220;Indeed, the Jesus that emerges from this historical exercise &#8211; a zealous revolutionary swept up, as all Jews of the era were, in the religious and political turmoil of first-century Palestine &#8211; bears little resemblance to the image of the gentle shepherd cultivated by the early Christian community.&#8221;</strong></em></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Aslan’s reluctance to tell a narrative story of Jesus’s life, as well as his emphasis on source and perception inconsistencies show through in the notes that I took while reading. Rather than getting a fuller picture of the life of Jesus (I was hoping to glean something more than the tired tales I had absorbed in the years of indoctrination at Sunday school), my notes are dominated with other details from Jesus’s world &#8211; e.g. crucifixion was a punishment reserved for sedition, and there is a seemingly endless list of preachers and revolutionaries who also proclaimed themselves “King of the Jews” (or were proclaimed that by others &#8211; the Life of Brian is looking increasingly prescient). Insightful yes, but not what I bought the book for. Not what it is sold as. What little I did pick up about Jesus from Aslan was less objective fact, and more theorising. And there are some inconsistencies in this theorising.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <strong><em>&#8220;If we expose the claims of the gospels to the heat of historical analysis, we can purge the scriptures of their literary and theological flourishes and forge a far more accurate picture of the jesus of history.&#8221;</em></strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>One of the main thrusts of Aslan’s portrayal of Jesus is as an illiterate peasant. But at the same time, Aslan ascribes to him incredibly nuanced motivations and deeds, often based on what would have at the time been a fantastical knowledge of scripture, history, and the sentiment of the people. Aslan’s wonderful theory about Jesus choosing ‘Son of Man’ as his non de guerre is a brilliant example of this inconsistency. Either Jesus chose this title because he knew of it’s complicated connection with David and the power of God (and wanted to use it for propaganda purposes), or he was a simple, illiterate, uneducated peasant. Aslan can’t have it both ways. But Jesus is not the only one whom Aslan grants outlandish prescience. Much of Aslan’s commentary comes from comparing sources written at different times, for different audiences, and under different circumstances. But more than just analysing texts through this prism, Aslan grants the authors the kind of propaganda skills and audience awareness that would shame even modern advertising agencies (Mark hasn’t just doctored the story, he has done so with clear knowledge of what his cosmopolitan audience already knows and will accept &#8211; let alone what modern audiences will accept). Even more, Aslan has the unfortunate habit of simultaneously using and abusing sources, as and when the need arises (he notably dismisses Celsus on one occasion because he is being “clearly Polemical”, while accepting his input on others). Sure, these are the only sources he can use, but there has to be a better method than poisoning and drinking from the same well.</p><br />\n<p> </p><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>&#8220;During Jesus&#8217;s lifetime, zealotry did not signify a firm sectarian designation or political party. It was an idea, an aspiration, a model of piety inextricably linked to the widespread sense of apocalyptic expectation that had seized the Jews in the wake of the Roman occupation.&#8221; </em></strong></p><br />\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>To paraphrase Aslan, who is in turn paraphrasing Rudolf Bultmann, Aslan’s Jesus is a reflection of Aslan himself. He is the Jesus that Aslan wanted to find; a mortal man and a complete contradiction. Aslan has not succeeded in his quest to illuminate the life of Jesus. He hasn’t given us an objective account of the life of Jesus, merely another interpretation. Where he has succeeded, however, is in inserting a fair amount of context into the life of Jesus. His portrait of the workings of the Temple of Jerusalem, and the intrigue in and around Jerusalem itself, are peerless. His highlighting of the succession of &quot;messiahs&quot; that preceded and followed Jesus of Nazareth, the myriad of nationalist rebellions that took place and the reprisals that followed, and the general milieu of Biblical Palestine are important additions to the popular debate over Jesus and Christianity. And this is where the saving grace of this book lies. It is a book intended for popular consumption. Yes, many of the ideas found in the book are not new, and some of the theorising is questionable. But the historicity of the modern conception of Jesus of Nazareth is something that desperately needs to be challenged, as does the inerrancy of the Christian scriptures. This book is incredibly readable and it’s description of Biblical palestine and Jesus’s context brilliant. Let’s hope that this, along with it’s high profile, is enough to reignite the debate.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So, it has been a while since I read a biography, and they are really starting to pile up on my shelf and Amazon wishlist. I decided to begin with the biography of Julius Caesar because he is such a looming figure throughout history and even in our modern culture. I grew up with references to Caesar; he was the chief foil in the Asterix books I loved, my Grandma’s dog was/is named Caesar, and his name lives on in the titles Tsar (Tzar, Czar, Csar) and Kaiser that are littered throughout our history textbooks. He has also inspired a great many of the other people whose biographies are on my list; Napoleon being the obvious example. In particular this book is a brilliant telling of a truly scary and inspiring human being. But it isn’t just Caesar who is inspiring. Goldsworthy has managed to construct one of the best biographies I have ever read. He has walked the fine line between too much and too little detail, an especially hard task when both the man and his world are so far removed from our own.</p><br />\n<p>Goldsworthy begins the story of Caesar by describing the world he came into: one where the kingdoms that had risen up in the wake of Alexander the Great were fading, where the four century-old Roman Republic was unopposed in the Mediterranean but which was starting to reach the limits of what the Republican system would allow. Goldsworthy maps out both Rome and its territories. He explains the functioning of the Republican system, with its infighting Senate picked from the Equestrian class, the order of magistrates that serve “limited” terms with “defined” powers and responsibilities, and a mob of plebeians who were both powerful and powerless. We are introduced to the principal actors of the day, which includes such names as Cicero, Pompey, Crassus, Cato and Claudius. But this is just the groundwork.</p><br />\n<p>At first the story of Caesar focuses on the goings-on in Rome while Caesar grew up, became a man, and embarked on his career (many of these side events have little to do with Caesar at first, but come back to affect him later). Goldsworthy readily and repeatedly admits that we don’t know much of the details about Caesar, one of the central points being when exactly he was born. Caesar’s journey to become Consul and his time as Consul is touched on briefly, but it is when Caesar is a Proconsul and goes off on his Governorship of Gaul that Goldsworthy really seems into his element. We learn in great detail about Caesar’s time in Gaul as he attempts to  “pacify” the Gauls and the Germans, fails to make headway in England, builds a never-ending stream of fortifications, roads and bridges, takes hostages, and caters for his army (apparently that last point is very important), all the while minding the political ramifications back home. Campaigns and battles are broken down to the slightest military maneuver (or our best guess at what happened during these battles based on the writings of Caesar, some of his men, and the scant archaeological evidence we have). I am sure by the end of the Gaul chapters most of us lay readers are eligible for some sort of degree in ancient warfare. For many the torrent of information about one battle or another may seem too much, but when you consider how Caesar’s mixture of skill, luck and daring contributed to his success, and how many others have drawn inspiration and knowledge from his campaigning, I believe the emphasis is more than justified. After all, Caesar become what he was largely through his military campaigns. The book is rounded out with the civil war with Pompey, and Caesar’s (relatively) short time as Dictator. I feel this section could have been longer, especially considering that many of us know of Caesar as a Dictator, and we have just gone through several hundred pages of build-up to this point, but this is just nitpicking really.</p><br />\n<p>If you take a look at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-author=Adrian%20Goldsworthy&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;search-alias=books&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goldsworthy’s page on Amazon</a>, it is immediately clear that his expertise and interest lies with the Roman military. This is reflected in the book, as more than half the book deals with the period from Caesar becoming Governor of Gaul until the end of the civil war with Pompey. But if you don’t enjoy tales of military campaigns, or if you are willing to put up with the authors fascination with them, then there is a great detail of story and information for you regardless. Goldsworthy faces the horrific task of not only having to introduce us to Caesar, but inform us about an ancient world that many of us do not know about. This he does well. How did the Roman society and republic work? Who were Rome’s contemporaries and what challenges was Rome facing? Goldsworthy answers these questions and more, and he does it well enough that it is entertaining, interesting and sufficient to understand the man himself. Furthermore, something that I thoroughly enjoyed in this book was the constant stream of political commentary, both that of Goldsworthy as well as that of Caesar’s contemporaries. Alongside the account of Caesar’s actions, Goldsworthy offers glimpses of the political fallout for Caesar, his allies and his enemies. It gives you a real idea of the intention behind much of Caesars actions, and adds colour to a very political life that some biographies miss entirely. I really enjoyed learning about such a prominent historical figure, and this book was an amazing vehicle for doing so. Four out of five.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "title": "Dead Aid",
      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I finally got around to reading “Dead Aid” by Dambisa Moyo, arguably her most famous wok, and one I see referenced quite often. Despite being written in 2009 (like many books that rely on economic data, it really doesn’t age that well), and despite an incredible amount of repetition (in his foreword Niall Ferguson was able to replicate Moyo’s entire argument in a handful of pages), Dead Aid raises a number of important issues and proposes numerous solutions to an important problem. Yes, as The Economist pointed out last week, Africa is “emerging”, but after more than a trillion dollars in aid shouldn’t this have happened far sooner and far more spectacularly?</p><br />\n<p>A Zambian-born economist, Moyo is in a unique position to comment on the effect of aid in Africa. She is also quite frank; “Aid has been, and continues to be, an unmitigated political, economic, and humanitarian disaster for most parts of the developing world.” She continues; “The lives of billions rest on getting the right financing solutions to the problems of developing nations. After more than five decades of the wrong diagnosis, it is time now to turn the corner and take the harder but indisputably better road.”</p><br />\n<p>On the face of it, the facts seem to back Moyo’s argument. While the economies of countries like Brazil, China, and India have exploded in the past three decades, the most aid dependent countries have had a negative growth rate. Since 1971 the number of Africans living in poverty nearly doubled. Aid dependent countries in Africa that once were far ahead of China in per capita income have since fallen far behind. And real income in many African countries is below what it was in the 1970s.</p><br />\n<p>While Moyo does not directly address whether these examples would be worse without the trillion+ USD that has been sent Africa’s way, she does offer several reasons why aid has not helped. First, concessional loans can inflate African currencies and become unserviceable when interest rates eventually rise. Second, when aid comes in the form of direct services &#8211; and here she uses the example of African mosquito net manufacturers &#8211; aid can crowd out African businesses, driving both entrepreneurs and workers out of productive activity, and reducing investment and entrepreneurial incentives. Third, aid in the form of government transfers is often stolen or used to supplement tax revenue, which is then inefficiently spent and makes governments more beholden to donors than to taxpayers and citizens. Government transfers also greatly incentivizes internal conflicts and corrupt behaviour, as whoever controls the government will have control of aid funds. And finally, and largely through crowding out, aid undermines domestic saving and investment. In short, Moyo claims that aid disincentives productive activity (like starting a Mosquito net business), and incentivizes inefficient activity; like corruption, conflict, and theft.</p><br />\n<p>In the place of aid, Moyo proposes that African countries look for new financial models. Firstly, African countries should encourage large-scale direct investment, the same thing that has driven China’s astounding growth. Second, Moyo encourages African countries to enter bond markets, something that will foster both accountability and oversight, and spur the foreign investment. Third, Africa should push for free trade deals within Africa, and with Europe and Africa &#8211; where it’s agricultural products will fetch better prices. Fourth, African countries need to follow the example of China, India and South America in better ensuring property rights, and developing micro finance organizations.</p><br />\n<p>Since the book was released in 2009, some of these ideas have already been put into place or otherwise realized. For example, <a href=\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/weekly/2013-03/08/content_16290076.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in 2011 alone Africa saw a 27% increase in foreign direct investment</a>. An organization I am involved with has begun a micro finance project in a village in Malawi, which has already proven to be a success in empowering local entrepreneurs and is something we are looking to expand and replicate. But despite these successes and examples, and while Dead Aid has drawn praise from the likes of Kofi Annan and Wen Jiabao (not to mention a forward penned by Niall Ferguson), there are a few issues with it.</p><br />\n<p>Moyo’s criticism of aid borders on fundamentalism, and her devotion to free market solutions borders on the puerile. It is more than a tad unrealistic to think that abruptly turning off the aid spigot will not lead to calamity and will lead to all of these ideas being full realized, and that something that works in China will automatically work in Africa. Furthermore, in focusing so stringently on the economic, Moyo has overlooked several aspects that define modern Africa. For starters, many African countries have exorbitant amounts of natural resources, and Chavez is a brilliant example of how an elected leader can behave without aid and with a steady stream of resource rent &#8211;  not beholden to anyone, especially the citizenry. Second, unlike China and like India African countries by and large do not have benevolent autocratic governments to ensure consistency, and do not have an ethnically and culturally homogenous citizenry. And lastly, Africa has a long, long way to go before it’s infrastructure will encourage the kinds of foreign investment that has drawn people to China. This is especially true of the countries in central Africa, who are increasingly the poorest countries due to their isolation. This infrastructure will take a lot of investment before it begins to pay off, and who will be willing to do that but aid donors?</p><br />\n<p>This is a great book to stir debate and I agree with much of it. Moyo has countless examples and insights dotted throughout, and it is a brilliant book to read purely for its sections on the history of aid and aid in Africa. The problems lie more with its age (a lot has happened since 2009) and with the uncompromising nature of Moyo’s argument, rather than the underlying reasoning. But the most important thing is that I definitely learned something. Much recommended.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

The World Until Yesterday is Diamond’s latest publication, and was only released on Kindle on the 10th of January this year. I figured I could jump on this book and maybe reference it a few times myself before it becomes passé. While I find the book to be very informative, it is an incredibly tough read, and often gets bogged down in minute details to the detriment of the overall goal.</p><br />\n<p>The World Until Yesterday is an ambitious project to look at “all aspects of human culture, of all people’s around the world, for the last 11,000 years”.  Beginning with the prologue of Diamond checking in at an airport in Port moresby, Papua New Guinea, Diamond sets out to describe the clash between the new world and the ‘old’. Following on and broken into chapters, Diamond examines traditional societies for the relationships within and between traditional societies, the particulars of war and peace, the way children and elderly people are treated, how fear and danger are harnessed and affect behaviour and quality of life, and the characteristics of languages and religions (this is far too short a summary, it is big and very detailed book). Diamond then rounds out the book with an epilogue of his returning from a field trip to Papua New Guinea, where he once again contrasts traditional life with his own life back in Los Angeles. But most importantly, as fits the subheading ‘What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies?’, throughout Diamond juxtaposes the aspects of traditional societies with aspects of modern societies.</p><br />\n<p>The idea behind this book is one I find brilliant. We should never stop learning from the experiences of others, and this book offers hundreds of examples of how traditional societies have tackled different problems in different ways. As Diamond repeatedly points out; either due to scale or ethical concerns (etc.), and whether it is how children should be raised or how criminals should be treated (etc.), modern societies are often unable or unwilling to carry out important experiments that could lead to best practice. However, chances are over thousands of years there are traditional societies who have faced similar problems to ones we face and have tried different solutions; e.g. as children develop should parents and societies micromanage them in order to ensure their safety, or should they be allowed to run free and suffer the consequences of their actions? There are traditional societies that operate at both extremes of this spectrum, and thousands that operate in between, why don’t we observe them and see which is best practice? Or to provide another example; should we attempt to eradicate religion (as many atheists hope to do) or does it provide some tangible benefits that some cannot see? Again, there are thousands of traditional societies out there believing and practicing thousands of different things, maybe we should look at them and see what benefits they are receiving from their practices, compared to each other and compared to more secular societies. The examples and possibilities of such an approach to research and public policy are endless, and whether discussing political structures, legal, structures, war tactics, domestic politics, religion, language, and culture (among many, many other things), Diamond draws from examples from around the world to highlight what we can learn.</p><br />\n<p>But with all this detail also comes a rather large downside. This isn’t a book that you can just pick up and read. It took me more than two weeks to read as I often had to get into a zone similar to studying. All of these examples can sometimes be laborious to get through or comprehend, and the names and regions can become quite confusing. And while some examples are gripping (such as Diamond’s own first hand accounts), some of them can be downright tiresome. Although this is a well written book, it has not been written for general consumption. Rather it is designed for those very interested in sociology, or those looking for a book for research and to quote from (a job it will do quite handily).</p><br />\n<p>All in all, this is an astonishing book if you want to see how truly distinct modern life is; whether it is how we view strangers (not as a threat but as a banal backdrop to our lives), how we trade (not to seal relationships but to acquire goods and services we cannot produce ourselves), the role of leaders and the state (not as mediators or spiritual guides, but as the institution with sole legitimate use of force within a society), or the legal system (not as an institute designed to re-establish relationships, but set out to ‘equalize accounts’, establish guilt and extract compensation). It is also an incredible book if you want to look at the experience and the thousands of experiments conducted every day by traditional societies, and see if our societies can benefit from this wealth of knowledge. I would not recommend this book for those who are not keenly interested, it is not a book to be taken lightly. But for those with the time, energy and interest, this is very much recommended.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I bought this book a fair while ago but never got around to reading it. Recently a few of my relatives borrowed the book and have begun raving about it, so I decided to give it a whirl myself. While I am not as besotted with the book as my family is, I must admit it is certainly thought provoking.</p><br />\n<p>The contents of The Trouble with Islam Today by Irshad Manji is pretty much what would would expect from the name. The author, Irshad Manji, is a self-described Muslim and “Muslim Refusenik” (you can read the book to find out exactly what she means by that), and the book she has written is part memoir and part open letter to “all concerned citizens worldwide”. In keeping with its by-line “A wake-up call or honesty and change”, the book examines Islam, and calls for honesty, criticism, and open debate over many aspects of modern day Islam. Manji takes the Muslim world to task for what she sees as the poor treatment of Women, a propensity for victimization, widespread “Jew-bashing”, the “dictatorship of desert Islam”, Foundamentalism (not a spelling mistake), innate tribalism, and the lack of critical thinking and open debate (among many, many other things). But what was especially noticeable to me was Manji calling for a greater operation of “Ijtihad”, a concept I had never heard of (and I am quite sure many others had never heard of), which means to practice the Islamic faith independently of religious authorities. In short, the book is a call for wider introspection and reform in the Muslim World.</p><br />\n<p>There has been plenty of criticism of this book based on the religious and historical veracity of many of the claims Manji makes (just as there has been lots of praise of her work). Personally, I do not have the expertise to critique on those grounds, but I do think this book is lacking in other areas. For starters, Manji falls into the trap that often befalls those who wish to critique religion from the inside; she has failed to outline the liability of God. In her criticism of the fallibility of the Quran, of the Desert Centrism, of the Lack of openness and debate, of the maltreatment of Women and other outsiders; the fault always lays with us lowly and petty humans. Never is God questioned, never is his divine plan questioned. It is a discussion of religion without a discussion of God. Maddening. Secondly, there is really very little groundbreaking done in this book, apart from the earth shattering revelation that it was authored by someone claiming to be a practicing Muslim. Many (if not all) of the Criticisms leveled will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has read even the most reverential atheist’s book, and many of the suggestions are also similar, with a little Islamic spin. And finally, the book is often hard to follow. As it is written as an open letter it is understandable that the writing is informal, however, Manji often goes on wild and long tangents, breaking her train of thought and causing the reader to have to backtrack in order to understand what is going on. The tangents themselves are often interesting, but it does lead to a very unsettling reading experience. This is one of the reasons the book took me so long to read, I kept having to double back.</p><br />\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think this is a good and important book. It has a great and important message, and I can understand how it will be more meaningful coming from a Muslim than an atheist (although that kind of fly&#8217;s in the face of the book’s overarching message). This is a book many people should read, especially non-muslims who have very little idea of the depth of opinion within Islam, but also Muslims who need to realize that pluralism, debate, criticism and openness are the only paths to progress. On the whole my criticisms and reservations with this book are mere nitpicking. I would (and will) recommend this book to one and all.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Having been so impressed by Isaacson’s portrayal of Benjamin Franklin, and not knowing nearly as much about Einstein’s life as I wanted to, I decided to also read Isaacson’s biography of Einstein. However, it must be noted that this book is not simply a biography. Isaacson has delved deep not only into the life of Einstein, but also into the world that he inhabited and profoundly affected; the science of the 20th century and the history of the 21st century. While this does mean the book is often a bit slow and convoluted, it also means that it is incredibly informative. It brilliantly paints the portrait of a vivacious character, a person far more interesting than the sum of his famous work. Correspondingly it also brings a greater understanding of Einstein’s work (both scientific and otherwise), and how it greatly affects us even now.</p><br />\n<p>So, as you would expect from a biography, Einstein by Walter Isaacson gives us a grand tour of the life of Albert Einstein. It tracks his life from birth to death, and visits many of the highlights along the way. Isaacson makes great use of much of Einsteins writings, as well the writings of his contemporaries. The book is littered with quotes from letters, essays and other publications, some by Einstein, some for Einstein and some about Einstein (apparently much of Einstein’s papers have only recently become available). But even more interesting is how much of Einstein’s life and personality is filled in.</p><br />\n<p>Isaacson tracks Einstein’s transition from a remarkable revolutionary to a grouchy conservative (scientifically speaking), from an ambivalent Jew to a champion of Israel, from a German National to an Internationalist to an American, from an apparent loner to someone who greatly affected history by being outspoken. Isaacson shoots down the myth that Einstein was so brilliant that he just happened upon his theories (in fact they took great amounts of time, courage, tenacity and hard work). And while Einstein may not have been the greatest mathematician at his school, Isaacson also points out that he was a gifted mathematician.</p><br />\n<p>There are really only two negative comments I would like to make about the book. For starters, I do not think it is as well written as Benjamin Franklin. While it is a much shorter book than Benjamin Franklin, I found it took me a lot longer to read. It is much easier to put down, and is often just too heavy to get in to. Second, I think Isaacson spends a bit too much time on Einstein’s personal life. While I understand this may be of interest to many people, and Einstein’s personal life was undoubtedly an important aspect of his life, some of the points were too laboured and often superfluous.</p><br />\n<p>If you want a more detailed picture of Einstein than the shaggy haired, pipe smoking genius, and a greater understanding of his influence on science and history, this is the book for you. This book is about more than an extraordinary life, it is about a man with an extraordinary passion for the world. In fact, Einstein’s zeal for physics, maths, and life, as revealed in the book, and the vivid descriptions offered by Isaacson, have even prompted me to start studying maths and physics again. While not as well written as some of Isaacson’s other work, I highly recommend this book.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

While I am very interested in American history, especially the story of it’s founding, so far I have found the books on the subject to be very dry. I start them, put them down, and then forget them. But, Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson is very different from any I have tried before. Isaacson’s work is a breath of fresh air. The former editor of Time Magazine brings a journalistic flair to what could have been a dry topic. Rather than a lifeless tome written by a tired old professor, this is a biography that is full of energy and passion.</p><br />\n<p>So, lets start with a little outline of the book. Isaacson begins with the story of Franklin’s arrival in Philadelphia, but then goes back and gives a full account of his life. We learn about the Franklin family’s migration to America, Franklin’s growing up and apprenticeship as a printer; we see his success as a businessman, politician and philosopher; we meet his family and friends, and hear of his role in the intrigue between America and Britain, the revolutionary war, and eventual creation of a new nation. Along the way we are introduced to a very interesting and complicated man. A man powered into history by curiosity, intelligence, determination, and a clear sense of purpose. One, who (at least in Isaacson’s opinion) defines the very essence of the American dream.</p><br />\n<p>In short, Isaacson’s portrayal of Franklin is both detailed and accessible at the same time. It is not only intricate and sophisticated, but very readable. Isaacson is someone who obviously loves history, and that love shines throughout the book. It is that rare nonfiction book; hugely detailed and a page turner. I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone who likes to read. You don’t have to be that enamored by biographies, Benjamin Franklin or American history to enjoy this book. But you probably will be once you finish it.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over the past year I have heard quite a lot about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455508381/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=1455508381&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=joshnichocom-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Khan Academy</a> from friends, family, classmates, and even Youtube. So a few months ago I finally decided to give Khan Academy a go. I thought maybe it would be a good tool for revising some of the Economics that I have forgotten, and some of the Science I never knew. Well, I have been downloading and watching the videos ever since. I have learned and relearned everything from Macroeconomics and how to calculate probability, to why it feels hotter when it is humid. I have found it so useful and unique, that I decided to give Khan’s book a go as well. I was not really expecting much more than your average book written by a do-gooder hoping to make some money to live, but this book contains a startling amount of information and insight on the history and deficiencies of the modern system of education. A very good and important read.</p><br />\n<p>So the actual content of the book is quite interesting. It is partly a history of Khan Academy itself, but most of the book is devoted to explaining the origins of the education system, pointing out it’s flaws, and, most importantly, posing solutions. Khan takes us through the first stages of the Khan Academy when he was just tutoring his cousin over the internet. He then introduces us to the idea that the modern educational system (in the United States and many other “advanced” countries) is a descendant of the Prussian educational model, which was based on an assembly line, with children moving through the stages of education in age groups. He shows that this type of learning has led to what he calls “Swiss Cheese Learning”; where many students have gaps in their educational foundations due to one size fits all policies, and policies that perpetuate poor learning techniques in the face of new evidence. He shows that systems like this penalize those that are different, do not adequately equip many with the knowledge and love of learning they will need in later life, and does little to recognize potential. Finally he shows us how using software and technology like Khan Academy, and techniques like “flipping the classroom,” could lead to much better education in places like America, and a very good education in places where it does not currently exist.</p><br />\n<p>So, as you might expect from what I have said so far, I found this to be a magnificent book, full of brilliant ideas. I love innovation, especially when in pivotal aspects of life like education. Furthermore, despite being someone who loves to learn I struggled in School, and I think many of Khan’s suggestions would have helped me and I think it could help many others all over the world. This new world of ours needs a new type of educational system, and some of Khan’s ideas could be the basis for that. I suggest this book if you are interested in education and innovation. I suggest this book if you are just a fan of Khan Academy and want to know a little bit more about it and the ideas behind it.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

      "content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I picked up the famous book “<a title=\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451651686/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=joshnichocom-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=1451651686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a>” a few months before going to Germany on exchange. I was planning on studying mostly history while in Germany and I figured I needed a refresher course before I arrived. Unfortunately, the book is so long, so convoluted and so boring that I didn’t finish it until well into my exchange. Even taking into account the 1280 pages, the book took me an abnormally long time to read. I found myself making any and all excuses to put it down, and I even finished two other books while I was reading it.</p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is the work of William L. Shirer, a noted American war correspondent, historian and an original “Murrow Boy”. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers much of the history of Germany between the ascent of Hitler in 1934 and the end of National Socialism in 1945. Shirer was stationed in Germany from 1934 until 1940, and much of this book relies on his own diary entries and first hand knowledge of events and feelings within Germany during this tumultuous time. Shirer also translates many diary entries by prominent Nazi officials, as well as proclamations and government documents issued by the Third Reich.</p><br />\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, this is where the positives of Shirer’s book stop. The book is positively mind numbing in a way that I have never experienced before. Normally I am a quick reader, and I am quite adept at forging through slow books, or slow parts of books. However, Shirer completely fails to string together any narrative at all. At best, this book could be considered a scrapbook of notable events and diary entries from within the Third Reich. And as such, fails to completely grasp the reader’s attention. It is remarkably easy to get sidetracked reading this book, as I found out during the 3 or so months that I was technically “reading” it. Shirer’s knowledge of his subject is remarkable, as is much of his analysis, however he quite easily digresses into the mundane minutiae of day-to-day life within the Third Reich, much of it completely pointless, and distracting, to those of us who want a big picture view of these turbulent times.</p><br />\n<p>If I wanted to learn history by reading a long list of dates, events and quotes, I would use the internet. The reason I read books on history is that I learn and enjoy it a lot more when history becomes a narrative. Granted, Shirer does use a lot of quotes from both his and other prominent diaries, which are incredibly interesting, but Shirer fails to capture that “continuous narrative” element that I look for in a successful history book. This is definitely a good book for someone studying German history to use as source material, especially since much of the work consists of translations of German diaries as well as Shirer’s own first hand accounts, but for the regular history buff I would look elsewhere.</p><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",
