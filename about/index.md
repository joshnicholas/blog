Ello. My name is Josh. I'm a [journalist](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas) and co-host a [radio show](https://radiosms.substack.com/) about the internet. Before that I was an [economics editor](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [technology journalist](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [executive producer](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) of a national current affairs radio show.

This blog is almost a decade old now. It began as a place to post book reviews but has slowly morphed into a kind of scrapbook. A couple of years ago I added a section for photos and, more recently, scribbles.

I've disabled comments as I am not interested in tending a dumpster fire. If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend Twitter.


Index:

Note: this is not a recommended reading list and is in no particular order. It is an index of books I have referenced on the blog. You can also follow me on goodreads.
