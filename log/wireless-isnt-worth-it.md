<blockquote>Charging the phone from completely dead to 100% using a cable took an average of 14.26 watt-hours (Wh). Using a wireless charger took, on average, 21.01 Wh. <strong>That comes out to slightly more than 47% more energy for the convenience of not plugging in a cable</strong>. In other words, the phone had to work harder, generate more heat, and suck up more energy when wirelessly charging to fill the same size battery.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/wireless-charging-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-48afdde70ed9">OneZero</a>.</p><p>My emphasis.</p>
