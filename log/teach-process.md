<p>It's staggering how few books I read that emphasise thought process over simple steps and results. Especially with art.</p><blockquote>Many students experience very slow progress in drawing because they haven’t learned that it involves much more than simply putting what they look at on paper. Instead, it’s more about how you think of, and process, what you see. They may have been taught to just copy what’s in front of them, with little or no involvement in a critical process. Many books show countless snapshots of what the various steps of a drawing should look like, but provide little emphasis on the thinking involved between the steps...</blockquote><blockquote>Drawing should always involve a critical dialogue between your eyes, mind, and hand. It’s not only what you perceive that matters, but how you process that information before it’s translated to paper. This inevitably leads you to question, should you copy everything you see? What’s important and what’s not? And to what end do you make that determination? These and other questions are critical to understanding the thought process of drawing and enable you to have a much more fulfilling experience.</blockquote><p>Just started <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/pen-and-ink-drawing-a-simple-guide/oclc/1032832501&amp;referer=brief_results">Pen and ink drawing: a simple guide</a> and it's proving fantastic so far.</p>
