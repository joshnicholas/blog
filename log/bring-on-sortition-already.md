<p>With all the angst about the electoral college in America, <a href="https://generalist.academy/2020/11/06/the-election-of-the-doge/">here's</a> an interesting tidbit on how medieval Venice chose its doge. Not sortition but I'm loving how convoluted and random it is:</p><blockquote>First, thirty members of the Great Council were chosen at random. Then nine of those thirty were chosen, again randomly. Those nine members picked the next set: forty people from the Great Council. And those forty? Twelve, randomly picked from their number, moved on to the next step. Those twelve chose twenty-five; those twenty-five were randomly pared down to just nine. Having fun yet?</blockquote><blockquote>This set of nine members chose forty-five more; eleven were picked – again at random – from those forty-five. The eleven chose forty-one members. Those forty-one (finally!) voted for the doge. </blockquote>
