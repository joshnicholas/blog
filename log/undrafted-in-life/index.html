<blockquote>The NBA Finals featured two undrafted, unlikely standouts in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alex-caruso-lebron-james-lakers-nba-playoffs-11600406618?mod=article_inline">Alex Caruso</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/duncan-robinson-heat-nba-williams-michigan-11576095466?mod=article_inline">Duncan Robinson</a>. Anthony Davis is No. 1 on <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30153524/nba-free-agent-rankings-25-best-players-2020">ESPN’s list of top free agents</a>, but Davis leaving the Lakers is about as likely as LeBron James retiring to open a taco stand. The more surprising players were the ones who might actually change teams: VanVleet at No. 2 and Detroit Pistons forward Christian Wood at No. 3. They, too, were undrafted.</blockquote><blockquote>“I carry that with me every day,” VanVleet said.</blockquote><p>I feel this. I don't think you can quantify how important that chip on your shoulder is later on. There's no better motivation.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fred-vanvleet-nba-draft-free-agency-11605671067">a piece</a> on Fred VanVleet, an undrafted NBA player who we're all watching right now. </p>
