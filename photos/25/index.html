<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>
<p>…the human mind is built to identify for each event a definite cause and can therefore have a <strong>hard time accepting the influence of unrelated or random factors</strong>. And so the first step is to realize that success or failure sometimes arises neither from great skill nor from great incompetence but from, as the economist Armen Alchian wrote, “fortuitous circumstances.”</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2272880.The_Drunkard_s_Walk">The Drunkards Walk</a> by Leonard Mlodinow. You can see this phenomena everywhere from politics to sports. We are quick to assign cause and effect, blame and praise, without considering the probability of it having taken place.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the brilliant <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking In Bets</a>, which I might break out again for another read.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230;When we look at extraordinary accomplishments in sport &#8211; or elsewhere &#8211; we should keep in mind that <strong>extraordinary events can happen without extraordinary causes</strong>. Random events often look like nonrandom events, and in interpreting human affairs we must take care not to confuse the two.

<h1><a href="/words/more-proof-trump-isnt-interested-in-learning-anything/" class="post-header">More proof Trump isnt interested in learning anything</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109421-the-fifth-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fifth Risk</a> by Michael Lewis, and, to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure that he does either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the story of the Trump transition. Or, rather, the lack of one. The book isn&#8217;t particularly long. More like a Vanity Fair column that got out of hand. Some of the vignettes of public service meander, too many are hagiographic, and there are more than necessary.</p>
<p>Lewis also explicitly repeats themes &#8211; that most of the problems with government are practical rather than political, for example.</p>
<p>But Fifth Risk is a brilliant portrait of what happens when the people in charge are thoroughly unconcerned with learning anything new. Either because they think they know better, tribalism stops them recognising anyone else&#8217;s competence, or they just don&#8217;t want to know.</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;A month after the election, Pyle arrived for a meeting with Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Deputy Secretary Sherwood-Randall, and Knobloch&#8230;“He did not seem motivated to spend a lot of time understanding the place,” says Sherwood-Randall. “He didn’t bring a pencil or a piece of paper. He didn’t ask questions. He spent an hour. That was it. He never asked to meet with us again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle eventually sent over a list of seventy-four questions he wanted answers to. His list addressed some of the subjects covered in the briefing materials, but also a few not: Can you provide a list of all Department of Energy employees or contractors who have attended any Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon meetings? Can you provide a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any of the Conference of the Parties (under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in the last five years? That, in a nutshell, was the spirit of the Trump enterprise. “It reminded me of McCarthyism,” says Sherwood-Randall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle vanished from the scene. According to a former Obama official, he was replaced by a handful of young ideologues who called themselves “the Beachhead Team.” “They mainly ran around the building insulting people,” says a former Obama official. “There was a mentality that everything that government does is stupid and bad and the people in it are stupid and bad,” says another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again, I&#8217;m not sure we didn&#8217;t already know this about the Trump organisation. So far I&#8217;ve read every book Lewis has written, and I will probably buy the next as well. But this one may be safe to miss.</p>
<p>The writing is pretty good though.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/another-adjacent-possible/" class="post-header">Another adjacent possible</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Working my way through one of the more fascinating technology books I&#8217;ve ever come across, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21948821-code">Code</a> by Charles Petzold. I stumbled across this passage:</p>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230;<strong>nobody in the nineteenth century made the connection between the ANDs and ORs of Boolean algebra and the wiring of simple switches in series and in parallel</strong>. No mathematician, no electrician, no telegraph operator, nobody. Not even that icon of the computer revolution Charles Babbage (1792–1871), who had corresponded with Boole and knew his work, and who struggled for much of his life designing first a Difference Engine and then an Analytical Engine that a century later would be regarded as the precursors to modern computers&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from a chapter on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean logic</a> (aka Boolean algebra), which you might have come across if you have ever studied programming, statistics or electrical engineering.</p>
<p>I’ve never before had it explained to me in such a cogent fashion. But what this sections highlights in particular (and the book as a whole rams home) is the power of bringing together seemingly disconnected ideas, theories and fields.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230;What might have helped Babbage, we know now, was the realization that perhaps instead of gears and levers to perform calculations, a computer might better be built out of telegraph relays&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great book if you want to understand how computers work, as it combines engineering and information theory to construct a virtual computer, step by step. Starting with a simple light bulb circuit, through logic gates, operating systems and graphical interfaces.</p>
<p>But it is arguably more valuable in demonstrating how something as complex as a computer draws from many fields.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/exercising-the-democracy-muscle/" class="post-header">Exercising the democracy muscle</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We have this view of America as a place of rugged individualism, but a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/losing-the-democratic-habit/568336/">piece in The Atlantic</a> argues this is precisely why it faces a democratic crisis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;participation in civic groups and organizations of all kinds declined precipitously in the last decades of the 20th century. The trend has, if anything, accelerated since then; one study found that from 1994 to 2004, membership in such groups fell by 21 percent&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Trump secured the Republican nomination by speaking directly to those voters who had the least experience with democratic institutions&#8230; among those who seldom or never participated in community activities such as sports teams, book clubs, parent-teacher associations, or neighborhood associations, Trump led 50 to 24 percent.<strong> In fact, such civically disengaged voters accounted for a majority of his support</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>For two centuries Americans created, joined and participated in &#8220;democratic institutions&#8221;, ranging from parents associations to sports teams, unions and even freed slaves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting concept, that democracy is not just something you are born a part of, but a skill or temperament that can be developed through practice. It also makes intuitive sense &#8211; teamwork and going through a process doesn&#8217;t come naturally, building connections and friendships can make it all easier. It&#8217;s why incumbent politicians are often more effective than rookies.</p>
<p>It also makes sense that operating at a sub-political level creates space for this kind of development. There aren&#8217;t the cataclysmic debates over things like abortion. It&#8217;s a lot easier to see how a fellow parent at your child&#8217;s school is on your side &#8211; both your children will benefit from higher standards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Voluntary associations have provided the people with their greatest school of self-government, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. wrote in 1944. Rubbing minds as well as elbows, they have been trained from youth to take common counsel, choose leaders, harmonize differences, and obey the expressed will of the majority. <strong>In mastering the associative way they have mastered the democratic way</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Democratic governance is never the most efficient means of running an organization, as anyone who&#8217;s attended a local zoning hearing can attest. Its value lies instead in harmonizing discordant interests and empowering constituents. <strong>A nation of passive observers watching others make decisions is a nation that will succumb to anger and resentment, witness the United States</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how you replace this kind of volunteerism, as it seems to be the victim of several irreversible trends, such as the rise of online communities (supplanting the local one), the explosion in activities to distract yourself with, and human sorting. But it does seem the importance is the practice, rather than education.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;One recent study found that, holding all else equal, greater knowledge of civics among high-school seniors correlated with a 2 percent greater likelihood of voting in a presidential election eight years later. Active participation in extracurricular activities, however, correlated with a 141 percent increase.</p></blockquote>
