<h1><a href="/words/artifice-of-it-all/" class="post-header">The artifice of it all</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the mainstays of modern life is GDP. Newspapers harp on about it, investors set their expectations by it, politicians&#8217; careers live and die by it. But until I read <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/GDP-Diane-Coyle/9780691156798">GDP: a brief but affectionate history</a> by Diane Coyle, I had never really appreciated how artificial the whole thing is.</p>
<p>Of course, GDP isn&#8217;t a natural phenomena. There isn&#8217;t a GDP-shaped mountain range somewhere. Moses didn&#8217;t bring us tablets etched with the formula. But that&#8217;s not really it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The concept of &#8216;national income&#8217; may seem clear enough, but measuring it in practice means choosing what to include and exclude, which is surprisingly fuzzy&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, from the start, our measurements were both malleable and rife with ideology. Obvious, you may say. But what we choose to include and exclude ultimately shapes how we view the world. And this is largely invisible. No one can &quot;see&quot; the economy. Very few can or do investigate the statistics. Instead, we go with the heuristics.</p>
<p>You may hold in your head that economics is a human construct but still come under the influence of its selective view of the world.</p>
<p>According to Adam Smith&#8217;s definition of productive labour, for example, <em>&quot;only those involved in the making of physical commodities, agriculture and industry would count toward national income.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The very essence of what is &quot;productive&quot; is a construct that has changed over time. And changed massively.</p>
<p>But perhaps Coyle&#8217;s most cogent example of this artifice is military spending. Again to Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;money spent on warfare or the interest on government debt was also being used unproductively. The nation&#8217;s wealth was its stock of physical assets less the national debt. National income was what derived from the national wealth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>First, compare this to the current system, which is essentially a measure of flows of income, expenditure and production, rather than a measure of assets or liabilities. Change.</p>
<p>Secondly, how big would our modern militaries be if their expenditure was still considered a drain on the national accounts? In fact, Simon Kuznets, the father of national accounts, originally tried to count military spending as a negative to the national output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kuznets, however, specifically saw his task as working out how to measure national economic welfare rather than just output.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With this aim, in fact, Kuznets was out of tune with his times. Welfare was a peacetime luxury&#8230; Before long, the president would want a way of measuring the economy that did indicate its total capacity to produce but did not show additional government expenditure on armaments as reducing the nation&#8217;s output.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Politics. With the Second World War approaching, governments needed to ramp up military spending. But, as now, the heuristic of growth held sway over the electorate. It&#8217;s an easy mental shortcut. So, the government changed the national accounts to include military spending on the &quot;plus&quot; side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By the time the wartime economists developed the modern concept of GDP, government was already a far greater presence that it had been. Subtracting Defense spending from the older conception of national income would have wrongly given the impression that the war effort was going to involve a huge sacrifice in private consumer spending.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#8230;early definitions of &quot;national income&quot; did not include government spending, because governments before the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had such limited functions. Paying for war, or similarly for the justice system, was seen as a necessary evil reducing national income, rather than a positive contribution to the economy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<p>Of course, we can extend this. There are plenty of things inexplicably included or excluded from our national accounting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The main reason for not counting unpaid housework as part of &quot;the economy&quot;, while paid housework is counted, is the difficulty of measuring it. Well, difficulty is not the right word. It can be measured by surveys, like the many other economic statistics, but generally official statistical agencies have never bothered &#8211; perhaps because it has been carried out mainly by women.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all need to remember this the next time politicians tout growth. We&#8217;ve chosen what goes into growth and what doesn&#8217;t. Our figures only show us changes in what we choose to count, what we currently find &quot;important&quot;. They say more about our current priorities than anything else.</p>
<p>None of our measures are immutable laws of nature. They are subject to whims and change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The imaginary line dividing productive from unproductive activity is called the &quot;production boundary.&quot; There is no sharp division in reality, so at the boundary there are arbitrary decisions, and this can be simply a matter of convenience. The border also becomes self-fulfilling, though, as being included in the national accounts definition of GDP is taken as a mark of &quot;productiveness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/lets-go-back-to-thinking-of-waste-as-an-input/" class="post-header">lets go back to thinking of waste as an input</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If there is one abiding image from my time in Sri Lanka, it&#8217;s the weird odds and ends that wound up in the fridge, covered by cling film.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t matter how little milo was left in my glass. The tiniest drop was whisked away to the fridge, <em>expected</em> to be finished later.</p>
<p>This is just a small example of something much larger. Nothing is wasted in Sri Lanka. Cars, computers, cans – everything can be put to another use. Anything can be mended or broken down, given away or put to some other purpose.</p>
<p>In the West this behaviour is, unfortunately, met with something akin to derision. Recycling, upcycling and zero waste are part of a subculture. I often visit my <a href="http://www.kimbriki.com.au/">local tip</a> or <a href="http://bower.org.au/">re-use and repair centre</a> to find perfectly serviceable furniture and gadgets. Disposability and planned obsolescence are accepted norms.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way from considering waste an input, consumption as a chain.</p>
<p>But this is a recent phenomena. Recycling and upcycling played a pivotal role in humanity&#8217;s rise. Many parts of the world have just gotten so wealthy they&#8217;ve forgotten about it. From <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Ghost-Map/9780141029368/?a_aid=thambili">The Ghost Map</a> by Steven Johnson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waste recycling is usually assumed to be an invention of the environmental movement, as modern as the blue plastic bags we now fill with detergent bottles and soda cans. But it is an ancient art. Composting pits were used by the citizens of Knossos in Crete four thousand years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we&#8217;ve been doing this a while. It wasn&#8217;t invented by the gluten intolerant.</p>
<p>But Johnson keeps going, and starts making interesting allusions to the natural world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We value tropical rain forests because they squander so little of the energy supplied by the sun, thanks to their vast, interlocked system of organisms exploiting every tiny niche of the nutrient cycle. The diversity of the system is precisely why rain forests do such a brilliant job of capturing the energy that flows through them: one organism captures a certain amount of energy, but in processing that energy, it generates waste. In an efficient system, that waste becomes a new source of energy for another creature in the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the magic – our cities were once ecosystems like this. Before we went to extraordinary lengths to haul stuff out of sight and mind, we had to do something with it. We, too, created energy and input loops. And they helped build our modern world.</p>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waste recycling — in the form of composting and manure spreading — played a crucial role in the explosive growth of medieval European towns. High-density collections of human beings, by definition, require significant energy inputs to be sustainable, starting with reliable supplies of food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The towns of the Middle Ages lacked highways and container ships to bring them sustenance, and so their population sizes were limited by the fecundity of the land around them. If the land could grow only enough food to sustain five thousand people, then five thousand people became the ceiling. But by plowing their organic waste back into the earth, the early medieval towns increased the productivity of the soil, thus raising the population ceiling, thereby creating more waste—and increasingly fertile soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collecting of human excrement was a venerable occupation; in medieval times they were called “rakers” and “gong-fermors,” and they played an indispensable role in the waste-recycling system that helped London grow into a true metropolis, by selling the waste to farmers outside the city walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s an obvious reason Sri Lankans and eighteen century Londoners are careful with waste. And despite the veneration, I doubt anyone really chose to be an 18th century &quot;raker&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m advocating. But the mindset is. Let&#8217;s go back to thinking of waste as an input. Just think of all the potential we are squandering.</p>
