<h1><a href="/words/fixing-the-news/" class="post-header">Fixing the news</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>&#8230;the news actually fails to deliver on its single biggest promise: to tell us whats happening in the world&#8230; It portrays the world to us as a never ending string of sensational, unusual, terrible, rapidly forgotten events. In contrast to fake news, which is misleading because its simply untrue, <strong>real news misleads us in a more subtle and fundamental way. It gives us a deeply skewed view of probability, history, progress, development, and relevance</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://medium.com/de-correspondent/the-problem-with-real-news-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-f29aca95c2ea">a piece</a> by Rob Wijnberg, founder of the Dutch media startup <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/">De Correspondent</a>. It is something I desperately wish I had written.</p>
<p>I became a journalist because I love learning and telling stories. I have a peculiar bent on the world and wanted to throw that into the mix. But I&#8217;ve found myself constantly foxed by many of the journalistic conventions that Wijnberg writes about.</p>
<p>The laser focus on the aberrant, the binary rather than probabilistic nature of expression, outsourcing of analysis to the establishment or a small pool of experts, bothsidesism, viewing everything through the lens of politics, and the need to publish discrete rather than iterative content.</p>
<p>These are just some of the many biases in modern journalism. But, unfortunately, none of them seem to be about fostering deeper <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<p>Most of all, I found my life ruled by &#8220;hooks&#8221; &#8211; filtering stories through arbitrary calendar events or something that has just happened. There needs to be a reason to publish this now, it goes, and the lens we have chosen is time. So we forego the issues that should <em>always</em> be published.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;news also <strong>makes us blind to the influential that is not exceptional at all</strong>. Thats why we often don&#8217;t hear about major developments until something highly improbable happens&#8230; The 2008 financial crisis, for example, didn&#8217;t become huge news until the Lehman Brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy  a highly unusual event. But the lead up to this event &#8211;   banks that kept piling risk on top of risk, little by little, day by day   never made it to the front page because of the <strong>fundamental mismatch between what was happening (gradual risk increase) and the way news commonly signals what is happening (event-driven sensationalism)</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if De Correspondent&#8217;s model is the antidote, or part of a suite of necessary reforms (I almost just fell into the binary trap there again), but it&#8217;s certainly one to watch.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the first thing we do is teach our correspondents to seriously moderate their own consumption of news. We encourage them to seek inspiration for article ideas outside of the days newspapers, talk shows, and tweets  by going out into the streets, by reading books, and, above all, by asking our readers the question, What do you encounter every day at work or in your life that rarely makes the front page, but really should?</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/truth-as-a-process/" class="post-header">Truth as a process</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia’s governance is a clever mix of technology, norms and processes. It started with the wiki technology invented by Ward Cunningham, which allowed anyone to write and publish (and edit) live web pages, together with an acceptance that <strong>while “truth” might be unattainable, nevertheless achieving what it called “a neutral point of view” was a worthwhile aspiration</strong>&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This from a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/02/in-hysterical-world-wikipedia-ray-of-light-truth">great article</a> about Wikipedia as the last bastion in an internet taken over by corporations.</p>
<p>What really strikes me, though, is the notion of Wikipedia not as a <em>respository</em> of information, but as a <em>process</em> for finding the truth.</p>
<p>Modern society is built around truth as revealed wisdom from on high. Now, Facebook and Google etc. suck up most of the attention and avertising dollars, putting many traditional sources of truth in jeopardy.</p>
<p>But the broadcast model of truth has always been flawed. Not least by how it is inherently captured by those who own and operate it. It is also predicated on passivity among those who consume it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, on the other hand, offers a model of truth as something we can all be engaged in, as something ongoing. It is by no means perfect &#8211; as nothing really is &#8211; but its potentially much better than what we are used to. And this is largely achieved through design, the tenets of which can be copied or extrapolated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;From a contemporary perspective, though, the most significant design decision was that every page would have a public discussion page attached to it, which meant that there would be <strong>a record of all the arguments that had led to particular changes</strong>&#8230; Controversial changes made without any corresponding explanation on the discussion page could be reverted by others without having to rely on a judgment on the merits – instead, the absence of explanation for something non-self-explanatory could be reason enough to be sceptical of it&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<strong>Reading Wikipedia discussion pages provides a way of understanding how a particular proposition or assertion came to be made and how it evolved over time.</strong> It’s like reading the transcript of an argument that has gone on for a long time – an attempt to track rationality in action. Like every other human-made thing, it’s imperfect. But in a polarised political climate, it shows what can be done to preserve us from the madness of hysterical, uncivil, conspiracist discourse that now characterises social media&#8230;</p>

<h1><a href="/words/what-happened-to-the-dynamism-of-religions/" class="post-header">What happened to the dynamism of religions?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Buddhist monks follow a lot of rules – 253 in one tradition, 200 in another. As the story goes, all of these rules were made by the Buddha himself. However, he did not announce them all at once, like Moses descending from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. Instead, <strong>they’re said to have evolved organically, with the Buddha making a rule only after he judged a particular deed to be a misdeed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, from <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-buddhist-monk-who-became-an-apostle-for-sexual-freedom">an interesting article</a> about the celibacy of Buddhist monks. It made me think of similar passages in a book I recently read about the Islamic world, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6240926-destiny-disrupted">Destiny Disrupted</a>.</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>During Abu Bakr’s khalifate, at Omar’s suggestion, all the pieces of the Qur’an were compiled in one place. It was a miscellaneous collection at first, because <strong>when the revelations were coming in, people recorded them on anything that came to hand</strong> &#8211; a sheet of parchment, a piece of leather, a stone, a bone, whatever. As khalifa, Omar began a sorting process. In his presence, each written verse was checked against the memorized version kept by the professional reciters whom this society regarded as the most reliable keepers of information. <strong>Scribes then recorded the authorized copy of each verse before witnesses, and these verses were organized into one comprehensive collection.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As I read books like Destiny Disrupted (brilliant by the way) or pretty much anything by Karen Armstrong, I am struck by these differences. At the time of the founders these religions were truly alive, and followers and exogenous events were directly part of whole shebang.</p>
<p>By contrast, the experience nowadays seems a lot more passive, of interpretation and extrapolation. Although there are some exceptions, such as some Christian denominations&#8217; belief in a personal relationship with god.</p>
<p>But Mohammad was consulted by his followers and the revelations even shaped battle strategy. The community was not only driven, but provided direct feedback.</p>
<p>Barring exceptions like the Ten Commandments, the narrative of the Bible also delivers a stream of guidance in reaction to outside stimuli. But, again, all of this stops once the key figures (notably Jesus) die. We are left with an ossified husk of their teaching.</p>
<p>Actually, worse, as access to these teachings were weaponised in the pursuit of power for hundreds of years.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/immigrants-assimilate/" class="post-header">Immigrants assimilate</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>&#8230;Overall though, lessons from the Age of Mass Migration suggest that fears that immigrants cannot or will not fit into American society are misplaced.  It would be a mistake to determine immigration policy based on the belief that immigrants will remain foreigners, preserving their old ways of life  and keeping themselves at arm’s length from the dominant  culture. <strong>The evidence suggests that over time immigrant populations come to resemble natives, and that new generations form distinct identities as Americans</strong>&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<p>Not sure about using names as a proxy for &quot;foreigness&quot;, but it&#8217;s an <a href="https://people.stanford.edu/ranabr/sites/default/files/cultural_assimilation.pdf">interesting paper</a> that is in line with other research in this area. Particularly notable are the results for lower socioeconomic immigrants, given the emphasis on skilled migration in so many countries.</p>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;We compare the cultural assimilation of immigrants during two waves of mass migration to the United States, the first from Europe and the second from Asia and Latin America. Using five million census records from 1920 and 1940, and nearly ten million California birth certificate  records  between 1989  and 2015, we start by constructing a “foreignness index” indicating  the  probability that a given name is held by a foreigner or a native at the time the name was given&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;In both periods, <strong>cultural assimilation is somewhat faster for immigrants from lower socioeconomic status.</strong> The rapid pace of cultural assimilation observed in our names-based measure is consistent with other indicators, including learning to speak English, applying for US citizenship, and marrying spouses from different origins&#8230;</p>
