<p>My name is Josh. Probably the most pertinent thing to know about me is that I love learning. It's my hobby. It's (thankfully) a large part of my job. It's a lot of what goes on around here.<br><br></p>
<p>This site is about a decade old and began as a book blog but morphed into a kind of scrapbook. More recently I have been concentrating on becoming a better <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/photos/">photographer</a> and <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/scribbles/">scribbler</a>.<br><br></p>
<p>By day I am a data journalist at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas">The Guardian</a>. Before that I was an <a href="https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074">economics editor</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12">technology journalist</a> and <a href="https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/">executive producer</a> of a national current affairs radio show.<br><br></p>
<p>You can also find a bunch of data I've liberated on <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas">my Github</a>. This includes <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/news_headlines">news headlines</a>, social and traditional media <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/trends">trends</a>, Colombo Stock Exchange <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/cse_scrape">closing prices</a> and the Australian government's <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/oz-covid-data">Covid stats</a>.<br><br></p>
<p>Over the years this site has gone through many stylistic iterations and been ported to several different platforms and blogging tools. Some links, line breaks, quotes etc. may be broken. The current version was created using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog">GitHub pages</a>.<br><br></p>
<p>If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas">Twitter</a>. I'm also pretty active on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/joshnicholas">Goodreads</a>.</p>
