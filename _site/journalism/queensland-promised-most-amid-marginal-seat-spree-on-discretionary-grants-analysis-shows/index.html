<blockquote><p>As the official election campaign kicked off on Sunday, with an election to be held on Saturday 21 May, Guardian Australia is tracking the funding commitments of both major parties and highlighting pork-barrelling in marginal electorates.</p><br>
<p>The breakdown by electorate of funding promises so far shows Labor has promised $756m for local projects over the same period – with more than 80% directed towards target marginal electorates, and just 2.4% promised for safe seats.</p><br>
<p>The party’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has promised to “trim” discretionary funding programs if Labor wins office, but has not gone so far as to commit to abolishing them.</p><br>
