<h1 class="post-header">Household names - 168 Australian companies have paid no tax since 2013</h1>


<center>From 10 December 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>One hundred and sixty-eight of Australia’s biggest companies have paid no tax since 2013 despite reaping profits totalling more than $9.85bn, a Guardian Australia analysis of new data reveals.</p><br>
<p>They are among companies included in figures released by the Australian Taxation Office on Friday detailing the revenue, profit and tax paid by about 2,300 of the country’s biggest corporations in the 2019-20 financial year.</p><br>
<p>Previous ATO data dumps cover the period between 2013-14 and 2017-18, making it possible for Guardian Australia to determine which companies contained in the figures have not paid tax over the seven years for which numbers are available.</p><br>
