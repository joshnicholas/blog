<center>From 24 March 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>In just over a year, the Clarence Valley and Kempsey have experienced drought, floods, bushfires and now another flood. Many other communities on Australiaâ€™s east coast are also dealing with their third or fourth significant natural disaster since 2019.</p><br>
<p>Before the latest floods, there were signs of recovery. Kempsey officially opened a new university centre on Thursday. The Grafton Regional Gallery in the Clarence Valley reopened the previous week. But these were either shut or empty this week as shops were sandbagged and locals avoided the floods.</p><br>
<p>The New South Wales government has declared a natural disaster in 24 local government areas that also experienced floods or storms in 2019/20. Six of those areas also had more than 40% of their area burned at the end of 2019.</p><br>
