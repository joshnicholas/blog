<blockquote><p>The New South Wales government has declared a natural disaster in 24 local government areas that also experienced floods or storms in 2019/20. Six of those areas also had more than 40% of their area burned at the end of 2019.</p><br>
<p>A Guardian Australia analysis of areas affected by multiple disasters shows that NSW contains 19 of the top 20 Australian local government areas affected by a combination of fire, flood, drought and storms. This is up from 15 in December.</p><br>
<p>On top of the natural disasters, they had to contend with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><br>
