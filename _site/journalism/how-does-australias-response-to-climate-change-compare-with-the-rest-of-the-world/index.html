<h1 class="post-header">How does Australia’s response to the climate crisis compare with the rest of the world?</h1>


<center>From 26 October 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>It’s a common refrain from the Morrison government, repeated again on Tuesday: that Australia is not only acting on the climate crisis but doing more than other countries. That the consistent criticism it receives over global heating is unfair.</p><br>
<p>Scott Morrison and the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, point to official government greenhouse accounts that suggest national emissions – in part due to Covid-19 lockdowns – are about 20% lower than they were in 2005.</p><br>
<p>They say this is a much better performance than other countries – Canada and New Zealand, for example.</p><br>
