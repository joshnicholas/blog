<center>From 13 March 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>China’s importance to the Australian economy has exploded over the past decade, fuelled by an apparently insatiable need for iron ore and helped along by increasing demand for luxury goods as the country became richer, analysis of UN trade data by Guardian Australia reveals.</p><br>

<p>Australia’s exports to China are now under threat from a trade dispute that since last year has seen dozens of coal ships banked up off the coast, racking up demurrage fees of tens of thousands of dollars a day as their captains wait for permission to come into port.</p><br>
