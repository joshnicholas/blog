<center>From 24 July 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The current outbreak in Sydney may take months to recede, according to Guardian Australia analysis of Covid-19 waves across the OECD.</p><br>
<p>It took more than 80 days on average to go from the peak to the end of the wave in the 80 outbreaks examined. The average is longer this year – over 90 days – than the 75 days in waves that peaked last year.</p><br>
<p>And the Sydney outbreak may not have peaked yet, with the New South Wales premier warning that case numbers will likely keep rising after daily recorded infections eclipsed 100 several times over the past week.</p><br>
