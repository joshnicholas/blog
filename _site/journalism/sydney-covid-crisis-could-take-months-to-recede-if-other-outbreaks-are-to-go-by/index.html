<blockquote><p>And the Sydney outbreak may not have peaked yet, with the New South Wales premier warning that case numbers will likely keep rising after daily recorded infections eclipsed 100 several times over the past week.</p><br>
<p>Experts say there are many reasons for the differences in severity and length of Covid waves across and within countries. This includes differences in population size and density, as well as government responses such as vaccinations, closing schools and retail, and issuing stay-at-home orders.</p><br>
<p>Other factors include where outbreaks began, as well as the different variants that have emerged throughout the pandemic. The magnitude and length of the waves themselves also affect each other, as rising case numbers can increase the number and types of locations where transmission occurs.</p><br>
