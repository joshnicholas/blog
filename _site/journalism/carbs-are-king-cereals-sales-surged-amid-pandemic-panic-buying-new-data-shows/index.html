<center>From 19 June 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>When the panic set in at the start of the pandemic, Australians rushed out and bought a whole lot of carbs, new food sales data reveals.</p><br>
<p>Sales of cereals – which include pasta, rice and flour – spiked by 40% in March 2020 compared with the month prior as people stocked up for the first of the Covid-19 lockdowns, the figures show.</p><br>
<p>The total amount of food scanned at supermarket checkouts rose by 4.5% that month compared with the year before. The year-on-year spike was even higher in Victoria at 8.4% in March 2020 and it jumped to more than 14% in September as the lockdowns dragged on.</p><br>
