<center>From 25 August 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>As new daily Covid cases in Australia continue to hit highs, experts say it is too early to tell whether vaccines are having an impact on hospitalisations and deaths.</p><br>
<p>Both Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian have recently claimed that the vaccination rollout so far has led to lower hospitalisations and deaths.</p><br>
<p>But experience from around the world and our own outbreaks last year shows that hospitalisations tend to lag case numbers by about 10-14 days. Deaths can lag cases by as much as 30 days. And while hospitalisations are lower than they were last year, they’re still trending in the wrong direction.</p><br>
