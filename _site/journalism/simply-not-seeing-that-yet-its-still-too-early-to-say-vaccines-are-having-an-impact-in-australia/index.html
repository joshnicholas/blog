<blockquote><p>But experience from around the world and our own outbreaks last year shows that hospitalisations tend to lag case numbers by about 10-14 days. Deaths can lag cases by as much as 30 days. And while hospitalisations are lower than they were last year, they’re still trending in the wrong direction.</p><br>
<p>So far there have been far fewer cases among older Australians since the current outbreak began than preceding it. Older Australians were prioritised in the vaccine rollout, and this may show some success in shifting the risk away from the most vulnerable.</p><br>
