<blockquote><p>Since the pandemic began, more than 57,000 people have returned to Australia on government-assisted flights.</p><br>
<p>But analysis of publicly available data suggests that many more Australians could have returned, due to spaces in quarantine facilities potentially going unused.</p><br>
<p>Many of those returning with government assistance have quarantined in the Howard Springs quarantine facility. In addition to the excess capacity of Howard Springs, analysis of flights and passenger caps shows that more returnees could have come through the hotel quarantine system.</p><br>
