<blockquote><p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br>
<p>The government was initially hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March 2021 and the entire country inoculated by October. Since then, goals, targets and “horizons” have come and gone.</p><br>
<p>However, in December 2021 the country had vaccinated 90% of the population aged 16 and over, and begun the rollout of boosters.</p><br>
