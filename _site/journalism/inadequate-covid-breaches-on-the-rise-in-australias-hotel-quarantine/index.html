<center>From 11 July 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Breaches of Australia’s quarantine system have substantially increased this year, with data showing there have been as many leaks recorded in the past three months as there were last year.</p><br>
<p>There have been up to 30 breaches – where a community case of Covid has been traced back to an infection in quarantine – since the system was established in March last year for Australian citizens and permanent residents returning home. Twenty of those occurred this year.</p><br>
<p>Experts say that the current system is “bound” to leak and that quarantining in hotels might be unsustainable in the face of more transmissible strains like Delta.</p><br>
