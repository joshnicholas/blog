<blockquote><p>Elsewhere, the delays could cause problems for medical procedures across the city, as some hospitals require a negative Covid test before entry for elective surgery.</p><br>
<p>Laverty Pathology, which runs drive-through Covid testing clinics, including one in Fairfield at the heart of Sydney’s outbreak, has acknowledged the “huge surge” in testing prompted by the New South Wales government’s requirement for regular tests had pushed out turnaround times to between 48 and 72 hours.</p><br>
<p>But Guardian Australia is aware of people who were tested at Laverty’s clinics in Rose Bay and Surry Hills, in Sydney’s east, and were still waiting for their results on Tuesday morning, more than 90 hours later.</p><br>
