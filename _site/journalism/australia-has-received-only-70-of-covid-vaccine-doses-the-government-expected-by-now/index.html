<blockquote><p>Based on these forecasts, and figures cited by the health minister, Greg Hunt, for the number of doses received from domestic and international suppliers, there is a shortfall of about 1.8m vaccine doses.</p><br>
<p>The federal government has previously blamed international shipment delays for the slow rollout, which could take a couple of years to complete at the current pace.</p><br>
<p>However, comparing the governmentâ€™s forecast with the number of doses we have actually received shows there has also been a shortfall in domestic production, with the number of locally-produced AstraZeneca vaccine doses lower than the government expected.</p><br>
