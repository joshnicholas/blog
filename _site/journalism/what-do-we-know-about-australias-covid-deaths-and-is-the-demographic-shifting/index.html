<blockquote><p>Since 1 June 2021 there have been more deaths in people in their 30s and 40s than the entire preceding period. Experts previously told Guardian Australia that vaccines have been effective at shifting infections, and therefore deaths, away from more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly.</p><br>
<p>Federal health data shows one teenager has died since 1 June and two people in their 20s have died, one of those since 1 June.</p><br>
<p>The national guidelines define a Covid death as a death in a probable or confirmed Covid case unless there is a clear alternative cause of death (such as trauma). This means some Covid positive cases may be counted in the national statistics even if there are other potential causes of death.</p><br>
