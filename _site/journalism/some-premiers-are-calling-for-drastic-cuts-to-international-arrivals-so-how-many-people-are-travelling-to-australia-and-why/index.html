<center>From 01 July 2021:</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>As Covid-19 cases force cities into lockdown across the country, the political spotlight has turned to international arrivals. The premiers of Victoria and Queensland are calling for a dramatic reduction to the number of people allowed to travel to Australia, with the Queensland deputy premier using figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to suggest too many non-Australians are travelling to the country.</p><br>
<p>Here’s what we know about travel to and from Australia since the pandemic started.</p><br>
<p>The number of people travelling to Australia is mostly limited by the “passenger cap” limit. The way this works is states and territories tell the federal government a maximum number of incoming arrivals per week they can handle based on “quarantine and related resourcing capacity”. The federal government then applies the limits. With the additional capacity of the Howards Spring facility in the Northern Territory, which takes commonwealth-run repatriation flights, Australia’s weekly passenger cap is currently 7,385.</p><br>
