<blockquote><p>Here is everything we know about the progress of the booster vaccination rollout.</p><br>
<p>Data from the health department, released in response to questions from Guardian Australia, shows 60% of eligible Australians aged 18 and over have received a booster, with the rate rising for those in older age groups:</p><br>
<p>The government has not been publishing booster numbers by age in its regular vaccination updates. Tracking the rollout of boosters in the older population is important as older people are more likely to die, or require treatment in an intensive care unit than younger people.</p><br>
