<h1><a href="/words/the-world-doesnt-fit-in-neat-boxes/" class="post-header">The world doesnt fit in neat boxes</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I wanted to add to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/nothing-is-obvious/">something I just wrote about</a> – the construction of our realities. It’s a topic much enriched by Gillian Tett’s brilliant book, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Silo-Effect-Gillian-Tett/9781844087587/?a_aid=thambili">The Silo Effect</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
…humans always assume that the way that they organize the world around them is entirely natural and inevitable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Tett’s book is primarily a reaction to the Global Financial Crisis. An anthropologist by training, she started to question why traders in the same bank were making opposing bets, how risk analysts could have been so blissfully unaware of the downside of some of these trades, and how economists and regulators missed the forrest for the trees.</p>
<p>The answer, she claims, is our unfortunate tendency to break the world down into neat little boxes. This can be effective, and even necessary, in our taking in and understanding the world. But the siloisation of expertise, information and people can be dangerous.</p>
<p>And it’s also not very accurate.</p>
<blockquote><p>
A common theme of anthropological research is that the way we classify the world never really matches the reality of our environments. People might draw neat diagrams of their kinship structures and family trees, but there are often ambiguities, overlaps, and underlaps. Things fall between the cracks. Life does not always fit into the official descriptions of what people are supposed to do. Much of the time we ignore these messy realities. It feels easier to stick with the neat classification systems we have than constantly rewrite them, be that in the sphere of kinship, religion, domestic life, or anything else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you watched any of this year’s campaign coverage, this should be familiar to you. Analysts broke America down into categories – white voters, women voters, black voters, latino voters, rural voters, working class voters; they ascribed motivations and prescribed answers.</p>
<p>But the world doesn’t want to conform to our little boxes. When it comes to institutions this can cause confusion, blindness and infighting. And, guess what, it does that in politics too. Maybe it’s time to question the boxes.</p>
<blockquote><p>
…the conventions that we use to classify the world are often not officially defined or spelled out. Instead, they arise out of a dense set of rules, traditions, and conventions that we have absorbed from our surroundings, often in an unthinking way.

<h1><a href="/words/nothing-is-obvious/" class="post-header">Nothing is obvious</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Like many, I’ve spent in the last few days in a state of disbelief. How could Donald Trump win? I was certain it wouldn’t happen. Not based on polls or probabilistic models, but my perception of the way the world works.</p>
<p>Trump just doesn’t get elected in a country with well-developed institutions, I thought. This is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa">something that happens in Sri Lanka</a>.</p>
<p>It’s this sense of certainty that I now find most interesting. It was <em>obvious</em> to me that Trump would not win. And this was shared by everyone I spoke to, both before and after the event.</p>
<p>But this certainty, especially this shared sense of the obvious, is a problem. As explained by Dave Gray in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liminal-Thinking-Create-Change-Changing/dp/1933820462">Liminal Thinking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The obvious is not obvious. It is constructed. We work together, as individuals and in groups, to construct the obvious every day. We band together in “obvious clubs” that defend competing versions of reality. When you walk into your obvious club, you will find people reading the same books, watching the same news channels, and talking to the same people, all of which tends to reinforce the same version of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of reality as a construct is not new. We filter our world through a lense, one made up of our experiences and beliefs. But the idea of a mutually constructed obvious – what one might call <em>common sense</em> – rather than an inherited or inherent one, is a new framing for me.</p>
<p>And this rings especially true as I think back on my many conversations about this election. So many of which were kicked off by the realisation we had read the same article or listened to the same podcast. It wasn’t just that my friends and I arrived at the election from the same place – as outsiders looking in. We were searching for bricks and gluing them together in our conversations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think something is obvious, that’s an idea that bears closer examination. Why do you think it’s obvious? What personal experiences have you had that led to that belief? Can you imagine a different set of experiences that might lead to a different belief?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a whole bunch of people taking a hard look at their priors right now, talking about breaking outside their bubbles. This is where you should start. There is no inherent obvious.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/maybe-being-unfocused-is-a-good-thing/" class="post-header">Maybe being unfocused is a good thing</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So, I’m someone who has always been too curious for his own good. Just in the past few weeks I have been trying to <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BLf31hEh-G3/">learn how to pick locks</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BLrpdfEBTIQ/">make soap</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BG8TCrhE-gd/">build an aquaponic setup</a>. And those are just the things I can link to (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/joshcnicholas/">follow me on Instagram</a>).</p>
<p>I’ve often considered this a negative. My inability to focus on just one thing means I inevitably have less subject knowledge than someone who specialises. My knowledge is wide but not really deep. I can talk to almost anyone, about almost anything, but not for very long.</p>
<p>But just in time for some post hoc justification, economist Tim Harford has written a book that makes it all ok. It’s called <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Messy/9781594634796/?a_aid=thambili">Messy</a> and it’s an examination of the beauty of chaos. Most of the media coverage has concentrated on Harford’s message that untidy desks and workspaces can be a boon, but it really extends far beyond that. From the power of improvised speeches through random events that upset path dependence in your daily commute.</p>
<p>And riddled throughout are some amazing anecdotes just for curious people like me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top scientists switched topics frequently. Over the course of their first hundred published papers, the long-lived high-impact researchers switched topics an average of 43 times. The leaps were less dramatic than the ones Erez Aiden likes to take, but the pattern is the same: the top scientists keep changing the subject if they wish to stay productive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The researchers investigated the creative habits of almost a hundred exceptionally creative people, including performers such as Ravi Shankar; Paul MacCready, who built the first human-powered aeroplane; Nobel laureates in literature such as Nadine Gordimer; twelve-time Emmy award-winning TV producer Joan Konner; great non-fiction writers such as Stephen Jay Gould; and a pair of double Nobel laureates, Linus Pauling and John Bardeen. Every single one of this galaxy of creative stars had multiple projects on the go at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charles Darwin, who throughout his life alternated between research in geology, zoology, psychology and botany, always with some projects in the foreground and others in the background competing for his attention. He undertook his celebrated voyage on the Beagle with ‘an ample and unprofessional vagueness in his goals’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few reasons Harford gives for the benefits of bouncing between projects. But in the end it seems to come back to something I have written about before – <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/">the necessity of letting in as many influences as you can</a>. There are some great rewards to be reaped by expanding your adjacent possible. Just think how important the interplay of geology, zoology, psychology and botany were in Darwin’s work. Would his theorising have been at all possible if he was a specialist?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practical benefit is that the multiple projects cross-fertilise one another. The knowledge gained in one enterprise provides the key to unlock another. This is Erez Aiden’s advantage. He moves back and forth across his network of enterprises, solving an impasse on one project with ideas from another or unexpectedly fusing two disparate lines of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychological advantages may be just as important. First, the point emphasised by Brian Eno, is that a fresh context is exciting; having several projects may seem distracting, but instead the variety grabs our attention like a tourist gawping at details that a local would find mundane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t enjoyed a non-fiction book this much in a long time. Not least because it justified my natural proclivities and confirmed my bias. Chaos is a fun topic and the sheer breadth of examples Harford employs keep it very fresh. Really recommend you go pick up <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Messy/9781594634796/?a_aid=thambili">Messy</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/when-time-became-ubiquitous/" class="post-header">When time became ubiquitous</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I’ve just finished <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Longitude</a> by Dava Sobel, a great history of the struggle to create a reliable method of calculating longitude. It was a quest that lasted for hundreds of years, fuelled by rivalry, prejudice, discovery and war (also, a smidge of science).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lines of latitude and longitude began crisscorssing our worldview in ancient times, at least three centuries before the birth of Christ. By A.D. 150, the cartographer and astronomer Ptolemy had plotted them on the twenty-seven maps of his first world atlas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while it’s easy to take a ruler to a map, orienting yourself on that map is another problem entirely. Especially so at sea, where landmarks are scarce. Lacking a way to devise longitude, countless lost their lives to navigational mistakes; shipwrecking or becoming hopelessly lost.</p>
<p>Luminaries from Galileo to Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke, as well as countless in between, worked to find a solution. Some were brilliant, if impractical – deriving longitude from the moon and stars; some were plain bizarre – a combination of magic powder and injured dogs.</p>
<p>In the end it came down to time. If you know the exact time where you are, as well as at your point of origin, longitude is child’s play to calculate. But creating an accurate timekeeper in the steampunk age, let alone one that holds up to a battering at sea, defied the best minds. In the end it was an uneducated carpenter named John Harrison who solved the problem.</p>
<p>He changed the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some modern horologists claim that Harrison’s work facilitated England’s mastery over the oceans, and thereby led to the creation of the British Empire — for it was by dint of the chronometer that Britainnia ruled the waves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the thing that has really played on my mind over the past couple of days is not this “big history” aspect. Rather, Harrison and his clock marks the end of being without time. Our lives are so regimented now, everything on a schedule. And that’s before we even consider the important timekeeping continues to play in making our world smaller – through its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">use in GPS</a> for example.</p>
<p>Harrison extended rigorous timekeeping beyond cumbersome and stationary pendulum clocks, invented parts that can still be found in modern clocks, and brought time to the waves. It was through Harrison that time conquered the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With his marine clocks, John Harrison tested the waters of space-time. He succeeed, against all odds, in using the fourth-temporal-dimension to link points on the three-dimensional globe. He wrested the world’s whereabouts from the stars, and locked the secret in a pocket watch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really recommend <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Sobel’s book</a>. It’s well written and fascinating account.</p>
