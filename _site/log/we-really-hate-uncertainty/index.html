<blockquote>One urn is see-through and contains a mix of 50 white marbles and 50 black marbles. The other urn also contains 100 marbles, but it is not transparent, and the ratio of black-to-white marbles is unknown. So the question is: “If you can draw a black marble in one pick, without looking, you win $100. Which urn do you draw from?” </blockquote><blockquote>Most people, Mueller wrote, choose the left urn. But why? Wasn’t it possible the question-mark urn was filled with only black marbles? Mueller explained that <strong>people usually picked the see-through urn to avoid uncertainty</strong>. At least when they could see the marbles they knew exactly where they stood. This type of decision-making is called the Ellsberg Paradox, named after Daniel Ellsberg, the man who introduced the urn test and established the concept of “ambiguity aversion.”</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://theathletic.com/2003233/2020/08/18/the-innovators-lament-why-ideas-like-the-shotgun-and-fast-break-get-rejected/">an interesting article</a>($) on why innovations in sports often take ages to catch on. Maybe explains why we're loathe to recognise it in our public discourse.</p><p><em>My emphasis</em>.</p>
