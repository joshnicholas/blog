<h1><a href="/words/are-there-fundamental-limits/" class="post-header">Are there fundamental limits?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Looking through history, especially the history of thought, you often come across pronouncements of profound limitations. Only for a paradigm shift to leave these notions in the dust.</p><br>
<p>The ‚ÄúMalthusian Trap‚Äù may be the best example of this. It shows how easy it is to get caught in modern paradigms, extrapolating only from what is currently possible or emphasised.</p><br>
<p>But are these limits always transitory, or can they actually be more fundamental?</p><br>
<p>I‚Äôve been wondering this after a <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/vaclav-smil-on-the-need-to-abandon-growth.html">recent interview</a> where Vaclav Smil posits that we are on the cusp of the limits of energy efficiency:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the fundamentals of human existence, the yield of crops, the energy which we save by making materials, the energy we save by making better converters, no matter if it‚Äôs turbines, or cars, all these things which run our economy are basically improving at a rate of one, or two, or at best about 3 percent a year&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It‚Äôs actually becoming more and more difficult to wring out even those 3 percent, because there are many things here. We are approaching thermodynamic or straight pneumatic limits with many of these things. This idea of dematerialization, decreasing the energy intensity ‚Äî fine, you can keep doing it, but you cannot do it forever. If I built a house, I can make it lighter, but I will still need some steel, some lumber, some tiles, some glass. I cannot make it not using material. This is another kind of false god ‚Äî dematerialization and decrease of energy efficiency. <strong>Energy efficiency is helpful, it‚Äôs happening all the time, but it has its own thermodynamic and material limits</strong>.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we simply innovate our way past continued consumption growth and trust compounding efficiency to make up the difference? Or are we up against something more fundamental?</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/where-is-the-power-in-a-suit/" class="post-header">Where is the power in a suit?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It‚Äôs hard to separate suits from a profound sense of obligation.</p><br>
<p>I‚Äôve always lived in places for which they are thoroughly, climatically, ill-suited. Yet they are still donned on the regular. As a signal that something is being taken seriously. Or that wearers take themselves seriously.</p><br>
<p>There‚Äôs a separation there, which has historical roots. But makes less and less sense with mass production and the shift of power away from the West.</p><br>
<p>The expectation-filling that guides (forces?) people to wear suits to work, weddings , court and interviews also seems thoroughly at odds with the notion of it as a symbol of power.</p><br>
<p>I‚Äôve never seen this articulated as powerfully as in this <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/30/20869237/suits-control-menswear-decline">Vox piece</a> on the decline of suits:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Although the suit is historically associated with projecting elegance, authority, and mastery of a profession, those qualities hearken back to the days when suits were prevalent, worn by the Atticus Finches and Don Drapers of the world. How long until we realize the suit ‚Äî while still used for special occasions and by a shrinking number of traditionalists ‚Äî has become associated with the opposite? The suit has become a uniform for the powerless‚Ä¶.</p><br>
<p>‚Ä¶.When you‚Äôre in control, at least in relative control, from the C-suite down to the long rectangular table in the open-air office, you wear whatever you want, which is almost never a suit. It is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/14/17792298/silicon-valley-stylist-fashion-tech">vest or bomber jacket for men</a> , a blouse or a shell top for women&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a class element here &#8211; which the piece goes into. After all, the decline of the suit as de facto <em>serious person</em> attire is largely taking place in a handful of industries, countries and social strata.</p><br>
<p>And, just as with school uniforms, there may be something to say for suits as something of a leveller. As a well-beaten path into &#8220;<em>respectability</em>&#8220;.</p><br>
<p>However, as suits become less normalised, and more explicitly worn for unpleasant occasions like court, will the association become more sour? Will the power of suits leech even more?</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/diversity-and-the-nuclear-bomb/" class="post-header">Diversity and the nuclear bomb</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It‚Äôs amazing where you find stories about the power of range and diversity in creativity and problem solving. This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/pandoras-keepers-nine-men-and-the-atomic-bomb/oclc/61315497&#038;referer=brief_results">Pandora‚Äôs Keepers</a>, which is proving to be a riveting account of the creation of the first atomic bomb.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúOppenheimer accepted the heavy security as a wartime necessity, but he adamantly refused to accept secrecy in one area: scientific discussion. Here, the normal security procedure of compartmentalization‚Äîlimiting discussion to a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis‚Äîwas not followed, despite protests from Army Intelligence. Oppenheimer held weekly symposia on the pressing technical problems of the moment, <strong>inviting solutions not only from the groups working on the problems but from the important cross-fertilization of agile minds from other disciplines with novel approaches and solutions</strong>. Just as in fission itself, one small suggestion could set off a chain reaction of ideas at a rapid rate. <strong>This fostered a cooperative spirit that maintained high morale</strong>. It was also a major reason why the bomb was built in such a short time.‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Oppenheimer appears to have underestimated the breadth of the task, originally envisioning Los Alamos as a physics lab on steroids. But it eventually grew into a site housing thousands of civilians from many different fields. Specialisation be damned.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/knowledge-is-a-double-edged-sword/" class="post-header">‚ÄòKnowledge is a double edged sword‚Äô</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I‚Äôve been reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/range-why-generalists-triumph-in-a-specialized-world/oclc/1050962413">Range</a> by David Epstein and damn do I have a lot of notes.</p><br>
<p>Hopefully fuel for some future blog posts. But, for now, I haven‚Äôt been able to get over this section in a chapter on non-experts solving problems that bedevilled experts.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúShubin Dai, who lives in Changsha, China, was the top-ranked Kaggle solver in the world as of this writing, out of more than forty thousand contributors. His day job is leading a team that processes data for banks, but Kaggle competitions gave him an opportunity to dabble in machine learning. His favorite problems involve human health or nature conservation, like a competition in which he won $30,000 by wielding satellite imagery to distinguish human-caused from natural forest loss in the Amazon. Dai was asked, for a Kaggle blog post, how important domain expertise is for winning competitions. ‚ÄúTo be frank, I don‚Äôt think we can benefit from domain expertise too much&#8230; <strong>It‚Äôs very hard to win a competition just by using [well-known] methods</strong>,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWe need more creative solutions.‚Äù‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is referring to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>, a site I haven‚Äôt yet found the bravery to crack with my new coding skills üòÖ</p><br>
<p>Anyway, it comes amid an exploration of problem solving, and how experts can be trapped by their domain knowledge, falling back into familiar patterns that haven‚Äôt worked. Meanwhile the answer, as in the case of some of these kaggle competitions, ie often from somewhere else completely.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú‚ÄúThe people who win a Kaggle health competition have no medical training, no biology training, and they‚Äôre also often not real machine learning experts,‚Äù Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, told me. <strong>‚ÄúKnowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things, but it also makes you blind to other things that you could do.‚Äù‚Äù</strong></p><br>
</blockquote>
