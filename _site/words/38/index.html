<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>&#8230;we focus on individuals who “passed for White,” an important social phenomenon at the time. To do so, we identify individuals coded “Mulatto” as children but “White” as adults. Passing meant that individuals changed their racial affiliation by changing their social presentation while skin color remained unchanged. Comparing passers to their siblings who did not pass, we find that passing was <strong>associated with substantially higher earnings, suggesting that social presentations of race could have significant consequences for economic outcomes</strong>&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We find that about 10–13% of 1910 Mulattoes were classified as White in 1940, and <strong>Mulattoes who passed for White earned 31–42% more than non-passers</strong>. Because passers tended to be more educated than non-passers, the increase in earnings from being classified as White decreases when we control for education, though it remains considerable at 20–31%&#8230; Passers earned 14–21% more than their brothers who did not pass.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/the-chicken-and-egg/" class="post-header">Technology and society as chicken and egg</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Is Twitter the cause or the by-product of our half-baked public discourse? <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191697">Paper</a> by Mark Kurlanksy is a thinly veiled rumination on this question.</p>
<p>Not Twitter exactly, but whether technology shapes society or is instead shaped by it. Kurlanky comes down very much on the latter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t paper and ink that spurred bureaucracy, philosophy, religion, drawing, painting, widespread literacy, or the accumulation and harmonisation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Rather, these technologies filled a pre-existing need, slotting in to a revolution that was well underway. Gutenberg didn&#8217;t so much kick-start modern mass literacy and learning, as pour petrol on the fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A technology that is intended to redirect society will usually fail. In fact, most technology companies do not introduce new technology but new ways to use ideas that already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Paper is very much a micro-history of, well, paper. Full of anecdotes of European water wheels, wind mills, buddhist monks and holy books. I’ve learned all I ever need to about the acid content of paper and the differences between rags and wood pulp.</p>
<p>But it’s Kurlanky’s reversal of technological causality that really makes this book worthwhile. Especially in the last few decades, we have become very adept at ignoring survivor bias and lesser-known forerunners, giving an extraordinary amount of credit to the Jobs, Zuckerbergs and Pages.</p>
<p>As if Google drove the internet rather than systematising and building upon the work of portals and curators like Yahoo. This is not to take away from these amazing technologies and technologists, but who really had the agency when it came to Google?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his seminal work Das Kapital, Karl Marx said that the Luddites failed because they opposed the machines instead of the society. He observed: “The Luddites’ mistake was that they failed to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but against the mode in which they are used.” In other words, it is futile to denounce technology itself. Rather, you have to try to change the operation of the society for which the technology was created&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot warn about what a new technology will do to a society because that society has already made the shift. That was Marx’s point about the Luddites. Technology is only a facilitator. Society changes, and that change creates new needs. That is why the technology is brought in. The only way to stop the technology would be to reverse the changes in the society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if Kurlanksy has me entirely convinced. But it certainly bears thinking about.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/the-cost-of-affirmative-action/" class="post-header">The cost of affirmative action</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>We evaluate the effect of introducing a gender quota in an environment where high-performing women fail to enter competitions they can win. We show that guaranteeing women equal representation among winners increases their entry. The response exceeds that predicted by the change in probability of winning and is in part driven by women being more willing to compete against other women. The consequences are substantial as the boost in supply essentially eliminates the anticipated costs of the policy..</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prior to affirmative action, women, including high-performing women, fail to enter the competition</strong>. Despite there being no discrimination, very few women win the tournaments&#8230;Although some high- performing men drop out of the competition, many women come in, and the overall number of high- performing participants in the entry pool is barely affected.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/be-more-skeptical-about-fair-trade/" class="post-header">Be more skeptical about fair trade</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve always been a bit skeptical of &quot;fair trade&quot;. Supply chains are long and complicated, there&#8217;s little oversight on retailer margins and it&#8217;s unclear how much producers actually benefit.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17302814">recently published paper</a> in World Development appears to back up some of these fears. The authors found that less than a third of the premium paid for fair trade Ethiopian coffee makes its way to producers. Exporters grab a healthy slice, and the cost to comply with certification is great for both farmers and cooperatives.</p>
<p>This is based on interviews with 1600 producers, cooperatives&#8217;s own records (numbering some 150,000 transactions), and data from the Ethiopian Ministry of Trade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an average Ethiopian coffee farmer, who annually sells the equivalent of 400kg of red cherries, were to market all his or her red cherries as VSS certified, with current VSS premium transmission rates, the farmer’s annual income would increase by 6.7 USD compared to the non-certified cooperative farmer (assuming both types of farmers sell all coffee to the cooperative). Even in the case of a perfect transmission, the annual income of the average certified coffee farmer would only increase by 22USD compared to a non-certified cooperative farmer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper also notes that certification poses significant barriers to entry. For instance, it requires detailed documentation in areas where many have not gone to school. Environmental and labor standards are admirable, but they also increase the costs for producers.</p>
<p>Producers that are able to comply with all of this are likely those relatively better off in the first place. The paper notes that certified households are more likely to be located close to paved roads and coffee cooperatives, and have heads of households that are older and more likely to have gone to school.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, do these standards really achieve anything?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;farmers in these settings often have diverse crop portfolios. They may be able to use sustainable production practices on their coffee plots but not on their other crops. Moreover, resources can be re-allocated within the farm from coffee to other crops, e.g., no child labor on coffee plots might mean more child labor on other plots. While coffee might have been sustainably produced and certified, it is possible that little might have changed in the aggregate at the farm, village, or country level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is one study, and it&#8217;s an analysis of just one country and cash crop. But at the very least it invites more skepticism.</p>
