<h1><a href="/words/a-utopian-plan-to-tackle-tax-evasion/" class="post-header">A utopian plan to tackle tax evasion</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="http://amzn.to/23oqC0N">The hidden wealth of nations</a> by Gabriel Zucman lays a great foundation for understanding the origins of tax havens and profit shifting, what drives them, and a possible solution.</p><br>
<p><a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-origins-of-our-tax-haven-problems/">I’ve talked a bit</a> about what makes it possible, and the coverage of the Panama Papers has addressed the second point, but we still need more discussion about a solution. And Zucman’s is interesting.</p><br>
<p>Zucman’s plan comes in two parts – the creation of a global register of financial instruments, and a tax levied on the lot. The combination of the two would negate the benefit of profit shifting – the tax is global, and of secrecy – in order to claim deductions or benefit from lower local taxes you would need to file a return.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“imagine a global tax of 0.1% on the stock of wealth withheld at the source. This means that each year tax authorities, drawing on the information in the register, would deduct 0.1% of the value of all financial securities, bank accounts, and so on.”<br />
“In order to recover what has been taken from them, US taxpayers, for example, would have only one solution: declare their holdings on their IRS tax returns. Subject to this declaration, they would receive a credit for any taxes that remain due—or see themselves reimbursed if they owe no taxes at all.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the combination of these two ideas, really, that is the breakthrough. A global financial register alone won’t achieve much – we will have a comprehensive list of “owners” of financial instruments, but much of it will remain opaque as shell corporations and tax havens muddy the waters. By leveraging a tax, even if net revenue is zero, we gain. We force opacity.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Without a wealth tax, there is a risk that even a global register might fail to identify who exactly owns what. Despite anti-laundering legislation that requires financial institutions to know who the owners of the wealth that they have in their accounts truly are, a not negligible portion of the securities could continue to be recorded in a register as belonging to trusts without a well-identified owner.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s throughout this explanation of the solution, that you really see the hole in the plan. Zucman is constantly at pain to justify himself, that his ideas aren’t utopian – in fact, they are all currently in play on a smaller scale. Constantly referenced, the word <em>utopia</em> makes its presence uncomfortable.</p><br>
<p>What’s stopping us tackling tax evasion isn’t a lack of ideas – even if you don’t appreciate Zucman’s. It isn’t even sovereignty, as something like Zucman’s tax allows for states to set and differ in their policies. It’s that the people in power, many of whom benefit from the status quo, need to be convinced to do something. That’s the utopia.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/a-one-quote-summary-of-a-problem-in-our-education-system/" class="post-header">A one quote summary of Australias education system</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are many issues with the way we do schooling. We’ve unthinkingly continued a system established during the colonial era. Designed to create homogenous widgets for the big machine.</p><br>
<p>There’s no reason we should lump children together based on their ages, or allow them to progress before they’ve achieved mastery. It’s not optimal for them, nor is it for us. It didn’t make sense then, and makes even less sense in a world that so rewards difference and creative thinking.</p><br>
<p>I’ve just started reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1qBqPw6">Beyond the Hole in the Wall</a> by Sugata Mitra. It’s the story of his fascinating experiments with self-organised and minimally invasive learning, made famous by his <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education">placing computers in Indian slums</a>.</p><br>
<p>Mitra champions the idea of setting children free educationally, allowing them to experiment, seek out what interests them, and teach themselves and each other along the way. He’s had phenomenal success.</p><br>
<p>Early in his account, he offers this beautiful critique of the current system:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“human beings generally consider knowledge to be irrelevant unless it “does something” for them. Much of what’s wrong with formal education lies in the fact that students don’t perceive how the knowledge they are getting will, in any way, change their state.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this is how I felt throughout high school. It wasn’t until I made it to university that I discovered education could be about more than test preparation. That it is something to enjoy for its own sake. That it can empower besides.</p><br>
<p>We have a system that doesn’t make sense. And we don’t even do a good job of selling it.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/" class="post-header">You need to expand the limit to your creative potential</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="http://amzn.to/23jZO1I">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Part history, part thesis, part guide. It sent me down more than one rabbit hole, as I sought to explore Johnson’s anecdotes and ideas.</p><br>
<p>The book is built upon a central proposition, one I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/you-are-what-you-let-in/">previous post</a> – our ideas are the sum of our influences. Johnson puts this more artfully:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“ideas are works of bricolage; they’re built out of that detritus. We take the ideas we’ve inherited or that we’ve stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This premise inevitably leads to several interesting conclusions. If innovation is fuelled by what has come before, the trope of the solitary inventor is nonsensical. So is the image of breakthroughs as the product of “eureka” moments rather than steady contemplation- something for which Johnson expresses particular disdain. Rather, new and good ideas are the product of openness, mixing and reflection.</p><br>
<p>It’s important, then, to be open to new things, in whatever guise. Your influences are the raw material of your ideas. As they expand so will your pool of potential ideas. Johnson illustrates this using the most powerful and beautiful idea in the book, one which he stole from biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman">Stuart Kauffman</a> – the adjacent possible.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>As originally conceived by Kauffman, the adjacent possible defined all the possible chemical reactions, the total amount of combinations, that could be achieved in the primordial soup. There is a finite number of combinations that can be made, but this number grows as each new combination brings with it more possibilities.</p><br>
<p>The more you add to the mix, the more you remix, the more possibilities. The boundaries recede. Ideas are just like this.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“The adjacent possible is as much about limits as it is about openings. At every moment in the timeline of an expanding biosphere, there are doors that cannot be unlocked yet.”</p><br>
</p><br>
<p>“Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn’t have reached from your original starting point.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>The key for all of us, then, is to expand our own adjacent possible. To keep introducing new sources, new raw material. The limit to your creative potential is what you let in.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“The history of life and human culture, then, can be told as the story of a gradual but relentless probing of the adjacent possible, each new innovation opening up new paths to explore.”</p><br>
</blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/you-are-what-you-let-in/" class="post-header">You are what you let in</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We live in an age where barriers are falling. Luck and skill are the only real impediments to my tweets, posts, updates or snaps setting the internet ablaze. The same can be said across industries and professions, as technology demolishes gatekeepers, shirks distance and weakens the moat of expertise.</p><br>
<p>It’s not quite right that all you need is a good idea. But almost. It definitely helps. The thing is, where do you get the idea? Where do they come from?</p><br>
<p>I’ve been taking a look at writing on creativity in the past week, reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1W92N7L">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> by Steven Johnson, and devouring <a href="http://amzn.to/237GKDM">Steal Like An Artist</a> by Austin Kleon. Actually, I’ve well and truly fallen down the Kleon rabbit hole. I’m halfway through his second book, <a href="http://amzn.to/228Skc6">Show Your Work</a>, and have spent far too much time on <a href="http://austinkleon.com/">his blog</a>.</p><br>
<p>It was an idea from early in Steal Like An Artist that really captured my imagination. Kleon is rather insistent on the concept that everything new is inherently informed by what has come before. There are no new ideas, but plays on old ones. Borrowings, remixes and mashups. As a result, it is vitally important to watch what you allow in. What you consume is directly tied to what you create.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just as you have a familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas. You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar idea runs through Johnson’s book, which is full of beautiful examples of inventors “borrowing” from other fields. My favourite is Gutenberg, whose printing press repurposed a bunch of pre-existing technologies – movable type, ink, paper, and the wine press – a tool ubiquitous in his homeland. The Gutenberg press wasn’t the result of a stroke of brilliance, a revolution or technological leap forward, but of remixing things that already existed.</p><br>
<p>Of course, it’s not enough to just open your mind and let all the good stuff in. After all, I have far more access to ideas and information than any of my 17th century heroes. So Johnson introduces another, related idea, the commonplace book:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters – just about anyone with intellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to keep a commonplace book. The great minds of the period – Milton, Bacon, Locke – were zealous believers in the memory-enhancing powers of the commonplace book.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In its most customary form, “commonplacing,” as it was called, involved transcribing interesting or inspirational passages from one’s reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Imbibing good stuff is the first step. From there, you need to do something with it. Write it down. Try and draw some connections. Read and re read it. Apparently this was something Darwin was wont to do, as he not only took down new ideas, but reasoned them out on paper.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.”</p><br>
