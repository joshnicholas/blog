<h1><a href="/words/there-probably-isnt-one-reason/" class="post-header">There probably isn’t one reason</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-information-hygiene-matters/">finally</a> finished <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>. It&#8217;s one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in a while, and ties together <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/gender-inequality-and-linguistic-determinism/">much</a> of my <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/">reading</a> and <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/">thinking</a> over the past <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/primed-for-determinism/">year or so</a>.</p><br>
<p>As a recovering determinist, I relish the celebration of uncertainty and the unknown. I&#8217;ve written quite a bit as I&#8217;ve read along. But here&#8217;s one more thought &#8211; the implications of uncertainty for silver bullets.</p><br>
<p>As much as we try to make the world bend to our will, there likely isn&#8217;t just one reason for anything. And so there probably isn&#8217;t one solution for it either.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The biggest things are unusual by definition. Unusual things often result from an <strong>alignment or interaction of many circumstances</strong> – that’s why they turn out big. <strong>By their nature, these will be harder to understand</strong>. However, this does not mean we have failed to research them as well as reasonably possible: in a world of enigmatic influences, research rigour does not equal nailing down. <strong>The best answer might be that there is no answer</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>The bigger the thing you&#8217;re trying to tackle or explain, the more influences it will likely have. Including ones you can&#8217;t see or measure. If you remove any of these jenga blocks, will your notion stand up?</p><br>
<p>This makes transplanting explanations or &#8220;solutions&#8221; from one context to another incredibly problematic. Your idea may have &#8220;fixed&#8221; the problem over there &#8211; and that&#8217;s a big if. But do you really know why? What about all the factors underlying that?</p><br>
<p>History is littered with simple solutions to complex problems and we&#8217;re all prone to creating panaceas. Modern democracies, especially, incentivise simple explanations rather than waiting, seeing and experimentation.</p><br>
<p>But the world defies being put in a box.</p><br>
<p>This is why public policies so often miss or fail entirely. Complex problems have complex causes and likely require nuanced and adaptable solutions. That it&#8217;s worked before or fits a particular world view isn&#8217;t enough.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;A favourite big thing, a silver bullet, has so many advantages: it’s easier to sell, to describe, to understand, to put into practice. But whether the thing we pick would travel, on its own, to another context is another question. <strong>Silver bullets seldom work once, never mind twice</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>As I have written previously, what this requires is a <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/">little more humility</a>, as well as institutions and a culture that can accept uncertainty and not knowing. Working with best approximations and striving to improve them.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/why-information-hygiene-matters/" class="post-header">Why information hygiene matters</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/">struggling</a> with the notion of beliefs as the output of a transitory and “swirling mass” of complexity inside each of us. Myriad tiny influences we can neither observe nor prise apart.</p><br>
<p>But, assuming this theory is valid, the logical conclusion is that the quality of the information you allow in is incredibly important. If that which inspires your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">System 1</a> thinking is rubbish, so is your thinking.</p><br>
<p>From <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Asked to account for our beliefs and choices, how often would we say it was an unknown nudge from the flotsam of incidentals? <strong>‘I probably only believe this because I pulled the equivalent of a red sock from my mental laundry under the influence of the last thing I heard in a bar. . .’</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>If the incidentals are so important, unpredictable and seemingly invisible, it’s not enough to swamp the bad with good. The only answer is to be incredibly vigilant about what gets in.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps this will prove easier than <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/">culling</a> the poorly informed and conscious conspirators from our social networks.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/where-does-your-belief-come-from/" class="post-header">Where does your belief come from?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve posted a lot of stuff on this blog questioning the foundations of belief.</p><br>
<p>How our beliefs are the <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/">function of the people we surround ourself with</a> or are <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/time-to-update-our-democratic-models/">built during our formative years and then ossify</a>. How language and culture both <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-the-west/">inform and limit what we can take in</a>. And that much appears to be <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-are-we-not-keeping-up/">stuck in formative states</a>.</p><br>
<p>But twice this week I’ve come across arguments that our “beliefs” are actually so transitory and shallow that they are all but meaningless.</p><br>
<p>That we are so riven with contradictions and so lacking a coherent world view that our “beliefs” are little more than fleeting notions backed up by post hoc rationing.</p><br>
<p>First in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds">an old New Yorker article</a> that makes me <a href="https://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/04/10/fact-checking-is.html">seriously question</a> ever again trying to change someone’s mind.</p><br>
<p>And now in my <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/singles-not-home-runs/">continued</a> reading of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We asked our volunteers to choose their political priorities on a scale of 1 to 10. For example, what would you do if it came to a choice whether the country should spend more on state-provided healthcare, or spend less and cut taxes (where 1 was definitely spend more and 10 was definitely cut tax)?&#8230;A short while later, we went back to talk over with our volunteers what they’d written and why. But <strong>we cheated</strong>. We left their original answer sheet as it was–written in their own hand with their names at the top to help convince them nothing fishy was going on. But where their answers were anywhere from 3 to 7–so not a definite 1 or a definite, uncompromising 10–<strong>we flipped the question around</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>These are quite long quotes, but bear with me.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>The partially handwritten page in front of them was evidence of what they believed–or so they thought. And <strong>it was this (doctored) opinion that they now defended</strong>. I sat down with a man who originally said that tax cuts were more important than more spending on state healthcare–and listened as he now explained why the opposite was true. His explanation was earnest, intelligent, clear, without hesitation. He wasn’t confused. <strong>He accepted this new position as a legitimate summary of his beliefs and didn’t miss a beat in justifying them</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>I’ve read of studies where people surrender their opinion in the face of a majority or authority figure.</p><br>
<p>But that we are so intellectually supplicant that an unrecorded belief is essentially meaningless has quite thrown me. And that we could be dictated to by a recorded belief &#8211; even a false one &#8211; even more so.</p><br>
<p>To a certain extent this merely lines up with previous arguments in the book about complexity and simplification. But the lack of stability in the “lens” we use to understand the world &#8211; that I can’t feed you similar information over and over and expect a somewhat predictable response &#8211; has huge implications for discourse and institutions.</p><br>
<p>Let me end with a concluding remark from this section of the book:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the ideal of holding a complete picture in our heads damns our capabilities with an impossible aspiration. The world, quite simply, is too complicated, too big, too messy, to frame in one go. The fact that we observe it in often contradictory fragments is also a measure of the enormity of the perceptual ask.</p><br></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/climate-change-is-already-here-its-just-unevenly-distributed/" class="post-header">Climate change is already here, it’s just unevenly distributed</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The title is from a <a href="https://twitter.com/kmac/status/1115403407433457665?s=20">tweet</a> by Kate Mackenzie, although I’m unsure if she was referencing someone else.</p><br>
<p>It highlights a central problem in tackling climate change.</p><br>
<p>By now most educated people around the world are at least aware of anthropogenic climate change. Even if they refuse to accept it.</p><br>
<p>So the problem is not really one of education, but salience. Even if most are aware of, and intellectually accept, the phenomena, it’s just not present in their day to day lives.</p><br>
<p>Climate change is already devastating farmers with increased variability and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/04/climate-change-rising-sea-levels-west-africa-coastal-cities/586651/?utm_source=feed">hammering certain exposed communities</a>. But for most it only really exists in the periodic news report. It’s like a far away war or natural disaster &#8211; easy to miss in an increasingly comfortable and abstracted day to day.</p><br>
<p>Given both the looming catastrophe and what we know of the health impact of pollution, it’s insufficient to simply “inform people” and sit back &#8211; the most comfortable mode for the news media.</p><br>
<p>Accurate reporting and discussion of climate change is more than highlighting the results. We have to engage with the process. The currently invisible must be made unmissable.</p><br>
<p>The question is &#8211; how do you turn something that takes place subtly and slowly, often only visible in the varied probability and intensity of “normal” events, into something that can’t be missed? That affects their day to day?</p><br>
<p>How do you increase salience?</p><br>
