<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Have you ever tried to mock up the outcome from a series of coin flips? It turns out that we are horrible at simulating randomness.</p>
<p>But as a great <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/70/variables/how-designers-engineer-luck-into-video-games-rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article in Nautilus</a> vividly illustrates, we&#8217;re also horrible at accepting randomness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;when video games truly play by the rules, the player can feel cheated. Sid Meier, the designer of the computer game Civilization, in which players steer a nation through history, politics, and warfare, quickly learned to modify the game’s odds in order to redress this psychological wrinkle. <strong>Extensive play-testing revealed that a player who was told that he had a 33 percent chance of success in a battle but then failed to defeat his opponent three times in a row would become irate and incredulous</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;So Meier altered the game to more closely match human cognitive biases; if your odds of winning a battle were 1 in 3, the game guaranteed that you’d win on the third attempt—a misrepresentation of true probability that nevertheless gave the illusion of fairness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notion of actual probability somehow being &#8220;unfair&#8221; is something to ponder. As is how the perversion of genuine probability can <em>feel </em>fair.</p>
<p>Are we more concerned with outcomes than opportunities?</p>
<p>It really is an excellent article and I recommend reading it all. It ranges from loaded dice found in ancient Egyptian tombs, to &#8220;pity timers&#8221; and faux improvement embedded in modern games, to gambling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The results of any modern slot machine are based on arcane random-number generators in a computerized network, not on the fortunate conjunction of three wooden wheels. But losing to that sort of luck can be dispiriting. <strong>So gambling machines often employ the fiction of physical luck</strong>—by, say, making it look as if you just missed out on a king’s ransom as the final matching bar of gold or lemon reels to a stop just shy of a jackpot payout. This entices you to once more bet on odds that remain astronomical.</p>
</blockquote>
