<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The title is from a <a href="https://twitter.com/kmac/status/1115403407433457665?s=20">tweet</a> by Kate Mackenzie, although I’m unsure if she was referencing someone else.</p>
<p>It highlights a central problem in tackling climate change.</p>
<p>By now most educated people around the world are at least aware of anthropogenic climate change. Even if they refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>So the problem is not really one of education, but salience. Even if most are aware of, and intellectually accept, the phenomena, it’s just not present in their day to day lives.</p>
<p>Climate change is already devastating farmers with increased variability and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/04/climate-change-rising-sea-levels-west-africa-coastal-cities/586651/?utm_source=feed">hammering certain exposed communities</a>. But for most it only really exists in the periodic news report. It’s like a far away war or natural disaster &#8211; easy to miss in an increasingly comfortable and abstracted day to day.</p>
<p>Given both the looming catastrophe and what we know of the health impact of pollution, it’s insufficient to simply “inform people” and sit back &#8211; the most comfortable mode for the news media.</p>
<p>Accurate reporting and discussion of climate change is more than highlighting the results. We have to engage with the process. The currently invisible must be made unmissable.</p>
<p>The question is &#8211; how do you turn something that takes place subtly and slowly, often only visible in the varied probability and intensity of “normal” events, into something that can’t be missed? That affects their day to day?</p>
<p>How do you increase salience?</p>
