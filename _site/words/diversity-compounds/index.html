<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>&#8230;we find that <strong>black students randomly assigned to a black teacher in grades K-3 are 5 percentage points (7%) more likely to graduate from high school and 4 percentage points (13%) more likely to enroll in college</strong> than their peers in the same school who are not assigned a black teacher.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;We envision role model effects as information provision: black teachers provide a crucial signal that <strong>leads black students to update their beliefs about the returns to effort and what educational outcomes are possible</strong>.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w25254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an intriguing working paper</a> looking at natural experiments in Louisiana and North Carolina.</p><br>
<p>It fits with similar research into the importance and lasting effects of role models. They spur our dreams, change our attitudes, and shape our beliefs and expectations.</p><br>
<p>A superstar &#8211; especially one that is <em>like you</em> &#8211; can completely shatter self imposed limitations. Take this from <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous recent paper</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Girls are more likely to invent in a particular class if they grow up in an area with more women (but not men) who invent in that class&#8230; <strong>These findings suggest that there are many “lost Einsteins”</strong> – individuals who would have had highly impactful inventions had they been exposed to innovation in childhood – especially among women, minorities, and children from low-income families.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>In the west we tend to focus on the individual. Often in zero-sum situations.</p><br>
<p>But when you add in the context of previous and future generations, we all have a stake in a visible diversity of success.</p><br>
<p>It will spur the next generation. It compounds.</p><br>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t we all benefit from fewer &#8220;lost Einstein&#8217;s&#8221;?</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br>
