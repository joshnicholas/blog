<h1><a href="/words/we-dont-know-where-science-might-lead/" class="post-header">We dont know where science might lead</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve just started reading a book called <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Longitude</a> by Dava Sobel. It’s a history of the scientific quest for a practical method of finding longitude.</p>
<p>Great minds from all over Europe, from Galileo to Isaac Newton, pursued an answer. And that’s what leads us to this great paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of their struggle to find longitude, scientists struck upon other discoveries that changed their view of the universe. These include the first accurate determinations of the weight of the Earth, the distance to the stars, and the speed of light.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no idea what might come from the pursuit of knowledge. The connections we can draw. Important revelations along the way. Some research is often scapegoated around the time budgets get passed, used as a token of waste. But this is a big presumption.</p>
<p>Some of the best science and discovery really begins when assumptions and predictions fail. We have no idea the riches that curiosity will reveal.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/the-perils-of-being-a-non-coder/" class="post-header">The perils of being a non-coder</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Coding is the literacy of our age. Soon, knowing how to code is not going to be an option. I’ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now, as I’ve gone about making my podcast. For instance, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thinkdigitalfutures/are-we-doing-the-right-thing-with-tech-in-schools">talking to primary school children who can already do more with their phones than I can</a>.</p>
<p>This point was really rammed home when I cracked open <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Program-or-be-Programmed-Douglas-Rushkoff/9781593764265">Program or be Programmed</a> by Douglas Rushkoff.</p>
<p>The entire book is a plea to take control of the devices that have become so enmeshed in our lives. But it’s this bit early on that really makes it plain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The people hear while the rabbis read; the people read while those with access to the printing press write; today we write, while our techno-elite programs. As a result, most of society remains one full dimensional leap of awareness and capability behind the few who manage to monopolize access to the real power of any media age.</p>
<p>And this time the stakes are actually higher. Before, failing meant surrendering our agency to a new elite. In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves. The process appears to have already begun.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rushkoff has put coding into a continuum that includes literacy and mass media. Just think of the power that has accumulated to those who could read while the masses were unlettered, who could reach everyone while the rest of us shout in the wind.</p>
<p>And it’s not just that literacy and mass reach bestowed power, they did so in ways that no one could foresee, and that the unempowered didn’t understand.</p>
<p>But what started as superpowers of the rich and initiated, that for a time were specialist jobs (scribes and journalists), have been extended to all of us. Became required of all of us. And we are all richer for it.</p>
<p>Coding will be the same. It’s not going to remain a specialist activity, the purview of unseen developers, but will become as common as writing.</p>
<p>The other day I met a girl who had created an app so she could share the books she had read with her friends. A boy had been given an assignment to learn his school timetable, and so had created an app to automatically give himself reminders in the morning. These are primary school students.</p>
<p>Yes, these are really banal problems. But that’s exactly why they’re proof of how important coding will be. Technology is ubiquitous. Offline and online are being melded. Coding isn’t just about creating the next Google, but about fully realising something that is everywhere. Those of us who can’t, will be the unlettered of the modern age.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/a-self-interested-case-for-lots-of-immigration/" class="post-header">A self-interested case for lots of immigration</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Watching the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting">rise of Donald Trump</a>, the <a href="http://time.com/4150676/david-cameron-european-union-brexit-talks/">success of anti-immigrant Brexiters</a>, the callous demonisation of refugees in <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/peter-dutton-says-illiterate-and-innumerate-refugees-would-take-australian-jobs-20160517-goxhj1.html">Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-protests-germany-idUSKCN0VF0P4">elsewhere</a>, it’s understandable to be outraged.</p>
<p>These are human beings, deserving of at least that level of respect. But this isn’t an argument that can be fought on moral grounds. It never has been.</p>
<p>The rise of populists and anti-immigration movements is motivated, in large part, by genuine fear. Australians are seeing <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-18/wage-price-index-abs-data/7424912">record low wage growth</a>, Americans are seeing <a href="https://psmag.com/the-future-of-work-why-wages-aren-t-keeping-up-6fcfac468e4#.q8fdapro7">similar real wage stagnation</a>, and other nations are too. Meanwhile, the European unemployment rate is heading in the right direction, but is <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/unemployment-rate">still shockingly high</a>, especially in <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate">some states</a>, leaving the spectre of a lost generation. And all of this is against the backdrop of the largest technological shift since the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>With this context it’s understandable that millions of refugees look less than appealing. That the <em>other</em>, especially an easily demonised <em>other</em>, is feeling the brunt. People are genuinely worried about putting food on the table, for their futures and children — let’s not go into zero-sum thinking fostered by our politicians and education systems.</p>
<p>The point is, this isn’t a debate you can tackle with “well, it’s the least we can do”. You need an equally self-interested argument. And I may have found one.</p>
<p>I’ve just finished the first chapter of <a href="http://amzn.to/1TPIKH1">The Geography of Genius</a>, a splendidly written first-person investigation of the connection between place and ideas. The author, Eric Weiner, is a long-time foreign correspondent and travel writer, so you can imagine the beautiful language and imagery.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first chapter is an investigation of ancient Athens. Why was this one place the progenitor of so much we take for granted — art, science, finance, literature, philosophy, and politics etc.? This is especially remarkable given the short span of Athen’s golden age, and that it wasn’t the richest or biggest of the Greek states.</p>
<p>The Athenians were particularly creative — dare I say, innovative. And the reason why comes back to <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/">something I’ve written about before</a> — they had a lot of raw material. Athens was an incredibly open place, it’s people travelling widely, and, extraordinarily for the time, foreigners were allowed to come and thrive. All of these influences came together and mixed, illustrating deficiencies not immediately apparent to locals, surfacing solutions from far and wide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The ancient Greeks didn’t invent much at all. They were, in fact, tremendous moochers. They borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, medicine and sculpture from the Egyptians, mathematics from the Babylonians, literature from the Sumerians. They felt no shame in their intellectual pilfering. The Athenians, for all their many flaws (see slavery and treatment of women), didn’t suffer from the Not Invented Here complex.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This willingness to borrow, steal, and embellish distinguished Athens from its neighbors. Athenians were more open to foreign ideas and, in the final analysis, more open-minded. At the symposia, they enjoyed the poetry of outsiders as much as that of locals. They incorporated many foreign words into their vocabulary and even began wearing foreign clothes. Athens was both Greek and foreign, in much the way that New York is an American city and not.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one point, Weiner very clearly links this openness and cross-pollination to commerce. Something we can see in some of today’s more interesting technology companies — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransferWise">Transferwise</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp">WhatsApp</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)">Telegram</a> were all founded by immigrants and exiles, largely solving problems not evident in their new homes. Nevertheless, they bring an incredible amount of wealth and expertise. Would any of these countries be better for locking them out?</p>
<p>The reverse example is also present, as evidenced by Facebook’s spectacular failure to bring Free Basics to India, <a href="http://www.afr.com/technology/why-facebook-and-marc-andreessen-offended-india-with-good-intentions-20160216-gmv4u4">largely thanks to a lack of cultural awareness</a>. Diversity is an incredibly powerful facet in the creation and dissemination of ideas. Even if you don’t immediately benefit from the diversity, you may do so indirectly — you might not get a job with Facebook, but your life is undoubtedly richer from greater access to friends and family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Athenians, master shipbuilders and sailors, journeyed to Egypt, Mesopotamia, and beyond and brought back every good imaginable. Embedded in those goods were some stowaways: ideas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ideas insert themselves into the fiber of merchandise and lie dormant until a careful observer unlocks them. This is why authoritarian regimes that believe they can open their economies but not their politics are fooling themselves. It may take a while, but eventually these subversive ideas, embedded in a can of tomato soup or a pair of Crocs, squirm free.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favourite classes during university was a history of China, a central theme being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism#China">country’s cycles of expansion and isolation</a>, and the accompanying booms and busts. Similarly, it can be argued that much of America’s success over the past hundred years comes from its immigration policy, its openness. Its being built on an idea, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-america-is-being-changed--but-by-whom/2016/02/11/834d3dca-d105-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html">rather than a foundation of race, ethnicity or religion</a>. We have so much evidence that openness works, that closing doors is nothing more than self harm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of these issues are viewed through a zero-sum lens. Each additional immigrant is feared as a source of more competition, rather than for any of the number of benefits they provide. As fellow consumers, helping to foster demand and bring economies of scale. As more-mobile workers, smoothing out booms and busts throughout he country. And, maybe more importantly, as a source of diversity, helping us plug gaps, learn from the countless natural experiments going on, and enriching our culture. Taking in more refugees and immigrants isn’t just a moral concern, we are all the beneficiaries of millennia of mixing cultures.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/cheers-mr-feynman/" class="post-header">Cheers, Mr Feynman.</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve recently entered the mind of a genius. It’s a book called <a href="http://amzn.to/1THQXNo">Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman</a>, a weird amalgam of biography and autobiography of Richard Feynman. Feynman, Nobel prize winner and popular science communicator, was an insatiably curious character – my train trip home was spent in wonderment at a series of experiments he did on ants, using Rube Goldberg-esque tests to try and figure out how they communicate with each other. But his antics extended far beyond this, to safe cracking, bongo playing and much more.</p>
<p>But it’s a short anecdote from early in his studies that really grabbed my attention this morning. Feynman, then a graduate physics student at Princeton, decided to take a course in biology. Because of course he did. Given a paper to read and present to the class, his reaction is brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles.<br />
The other students in the class interrupt me: ‘We know all that!’<br />
‘Oh,’ I say, ‘you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you’ve had four years of biology.’ They had wasted all their time memorising stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the way we educate, test, live and learn is broken, is not a new argument on this blog. But consider the context of this reaction. This is Feynman in the early 1940s. When knowledge was still locked away in expensive books, guarded by jealous librarians. Long before search engines, hyperlinks, the mass digitisation of books and online encyclopaedias. Yet Feynman was already decrying our fetishisation of memorisation over understanding.</p>
<p>What excuse do we have now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!”</p>
</blockquote>
