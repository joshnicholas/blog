<blockquote>Education researchers have known for decades that <strong>being good at something and being good at teaching something are two completely different skill sets</strong>. In fact, universities are mostly ranked on the strength of their research, and, of course, the brand name can be worth a lot. Something similar holds true for MasterClass, whose impressive roster of talent feels like a who’s who of elite professionals, a gallery of the meritocracy’s winners.</blockquote><p>The easy, obvious heuristics are, often, just so bad. How many simple signals of what’s good or proper are actually just status quo bias rather than reliable indicators we should use to make decisions?</p><p>From an interesting <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/what-is-masterclass-actually-selling/614200/">article on Masterclass</a> in The Atlantic.</p><p><em>My emphasis</em>.</p>
