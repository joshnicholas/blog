<h1><a href="/words/why-china-is-pantsing-us-when-it-comes-to-education/" class="post-header">Why China is pantsing us when it comes to education</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been writing a lot about education recently. Rants about <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/a-one-quote-summary-of-a-problem-in-our-education-system/">our stupid industrial model</a>, on how we need <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/i-wish-i-had-been-unschooled/">something that more conforms with the needs of the modern day</a> – curiosity, critical thinking, and research over rote.</p>
<p>But even within our terrible model there are inequities to address. Some states are far better at turning out widget-people than others. Countries like Australia are <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/the-toughest-question-of-all-why-is-australia-falling-behind-in-maths-20150706-gi5ztd.html">falling behind in international rankings</a>. And the way we approach teachers and teaching may be a big reason why.</p>
<p>I’m about halfway through <a href="http://amzn.to/1YG0c3P">Free Schools</a> by David Gillespie. It’s essentially an examination of the Australian education system, from the point of view of a parent trying to decide whether to send his children to a government or “private” school. Gillespie scrutinises a lot of factors – class and school size, religion, gender and age segregation, government schools, charter schools, unions etc. etc.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of stuff to unpack here, which I hope to get to eventually. But something I read on the train this morning has stuck. A lot of the countries that are succeeding in our broken system have a great approach to teachers and teaching. They emphasise it as a craft and provide a method for constant finessing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A Shanghai teacher with less than five years’ experience is assigned two mentors, one for classroom management and one for subject-specific guidance. The mentors are teachers with five to ten years’ experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Gillespie, teachers in Shanghai have enormous space and resources to improve their craft. They are given a three-year development plan, and mentors to act both as examples (they spend days observing their mentors’ classes), as well as to provide feedback on their own teaching practices (the mentors sit in classes and give them advice on teaching plans and delivery). As teachers progress through their career they are given increasingly experienced mentors, and they themselves become mentors. They aren’t promoted out of the classroom, their talent and expertise isn’t incentivised to leave the system.</p>
<p>The teacher’s are also leaned upon to help improve the system from within. To critically analyse it from the front line. They join groups aimed at improving student results, to research, evaluate and apply strategies to make schools and education more effective. They conduct their own original research, submitting papers to academic journals. They are, in other words, treated in a similar fashion to lawyers, doctors or any other knowledge professional.</p>
<p>This is all <strong>after</strong> they have graduated, and <strong>continues well into their careers</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[in Shanghai] teachers are expected to learn following the cycle of study–practise–analyse then start again.”</p>
<p>“There’s a constant and pervasive culture of teacher-performance mentoring – not monitoring, mentoring. Teachers are treated like the professionals they are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the complete opposite to how Australia has tackled improving education – playing on the margins by focusing on superficial gains like reducing class size (this has not proven effective). As Gillespie points out, painfully, over and over, the concept of teaching as a skill is absent in our discourse. We leave our teachers alone, on an island with their students. We don’t support them the way Shanghai does, or encourage them to improve the system. And education largely ends at uni. What little further training they get is spotty, and largely centred around things they might need to teach – not teaching itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Australian teachers reported that they received little or no constructive feedback from the programs, it was rarely based on classroom observation and, as a result, it was disconnected from student learning. Most teacher professional development consisted of attendance at one-off courses and wasn’t part of any longer term collaborative research program.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a big caveat here. The countries Gillespie namedrops are different to ours in fundamental ways. Age and governance-wise yes, but also culturally. Many of these well-performing countries are what’s known as collectivist cultures, <a href="http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Collectivist_and_individualist_cultures">while we are individualist</a>. Collectivist cultures, like that of China and Japan, emphasize group goals above individual needs or desire. See if you can catch a hint of that in this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Asian and Finnish school teachers are not compensated based on their students’ performance, they work together as professionals to ensure they’re all more effective teachers. That students perform better is an outcome of better teaching, not a means of calculating the teachers’ weekly salary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would assume our emphasis on incentive structure and individuals probably has a lot to do with our individualist culture. Although don’t quote me on that. The main point is, countries like China obviously have a much healthier take on how to treat and train teachers.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/a-utopian-plan-to-tackle-tax-evasion/" class="post-header">A utopian plan to tackle tax evasion</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="http://amzn.to/23oqC0N">The hidden wealth of nations</a> by Gabriel Zucman lays a great foundation for understanding the origins of tax havens and profit shifting, what drives them, and a possible solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-origins-of-our-tax-haven-problems/">I’ve talked a bit</a> about what makes it possible, and the coverage of the Panama Papers has addressed the second point, but we still need more discussion about a solution. And Zucman’s is interesting.</p>
<p>Zucman’s plan comes in two parts – the creation of a global register of financial instruments, and a tax levied on the lot. The combination of the two would negate the benefit of profit shifting – the tax is global, and of secrecy – in order to claim deductions or benefit from lower local taxes you would need to file a return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“imagine a global tax of 0.1% on the stock of wealth withheld at the source. This means that each year tax authorities, drawing on the information in the register, would deduct 0.1% of the value of all financial securities, bank accounts, and so on.”<br />
“In order to recover what has been taken from them, US taxpayers, for example, would have only one solution: declare their holdings on their IRS tax returns. Subject to this declaration, they would receive a credit for any taxes that remain due—or see themselves reimbursed if they owe no taxes at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the combination of these two ideas, really, that is the breakthrough. A global financial register alone won’t achieve much – we will have a comprehensive list of “owners” of financial instruments, but much of it will remain opaque as shell corporations and tax havens muddy the waters. By leveraging a tax, even if net revenue is zero, we gain. We force opacity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Without a wealth tax, there is a risk that even a global register might fail to identify who exactly owns what. Despite anti-laundering legislation that requires financial institutions to know who the owners of the wealth that they have in their accounts truly are, a not negligible portion of the securities could continue to be recorded in a register as belonging to trusts without a well-identified owner.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s throughout this explanation of the solution, that you really see the hole in the plan. Zucman is constantly at pain to justify himself, that his ideas aren’t utopian – in fact, they are all currently in play on a smaller scale. Constantly referenced, the word <em>utopia</em> makes its presence uncomfortable.</p>
<p>What’s stopping us tackling tax evasion isn’t a lack of ideas – even if you don’t appreciate Zucman’s. It isn’t even sovereignty, as something like Zucman’s tax allows for states to set and differ in their policies. It’s that the people in power, many of whom benefit from the status quo, need to be convinced to do something. That’s the utopia.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/a-one-quote-summary-of-a-problem-in-our-education-system/" class="post-header">A one quote summary of Australias education system</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are many issues with the way we do schooling. We’ve unthinkingly continued a system established during the colonial era. Designed to create homogenous widgets for the big machine.</p>
<p>There’s no reason we should lump children together based on their ages, or allow them to progress before they’ve achieved mastery. It’s not optimal for them, nor is it for us. It didn’t make sense then, and makes even less sense in a world that so rewards difference and creative thinking.</p>
<p>I’ve just started reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1qBqPw6">Beyond the Hole in the Wall</a> by Sugata Mitra. It’s the story of his fascinating experiments with self-organised and minimally invasive learning, made famous by his <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education">placing computers in Indian slums</a>.</p>
<p>Mitra champions the idea of setting children free educationally, allowing them to experiment, seek out what interests them, and teach themselves and each other along the way. He’s had phenomenal success.</p>
<p>Early in his account, he offers this beautiful critique of the current system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“human beings generally consider knowledge to be irrelevant unless it “does something” for them. Much of what’s wrong with formal education lies in the fact that students don’t perceive how the knowledge they are getting will, in any way, change their state.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this is how I felt throughout high school. It wasn’t until I made it to university that I discovered education could be about more than test preparation. That it is something to enjoy for its own sake. That it can empower besides.</p>
<p>We have a system that doesn’t make sense. And we don’t even do a good job of selling it.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/" class="post-header">You need to expand the limit to your creative potential</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="http://amzn.to/23jZO1I">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Part history, part thesis, part guide. It sent me down more than one rabbit hole, as I sought to explore Johnson’s anecdotes and ideas.</p>
<p>The book is built upon a central proposition, one I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/you-are-what-you-let-in/">previous post</a> – our ideas are the sum of our influences. Johnson puts this more artfully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ideas are works of bricolage; they’re built out of that detritus. We take the ideas we’ve inherited or that we’ve stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This premise inevitably leads to several interesting conclusions. If innovation is fuelled by what has come before, the trope of the solitary inventor is nonsensical. So is the image of breakthroughs as the product of “eureka” moments rather than steady contemplation- something for which Johnson expresses particular disdain. Rather, new and good ideas are the product of openness, mixing and reflection.</p>
<p>It’s important, then, to be open to new things, in whatever guise. Your influences are the raw material of your ideas. As they expand so will your pool of potential ideas. Johnson illustrates this using the most powerful and beautiful idea in the book, one which he stole from biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman">Stuart Kauffman</a> – the adjacent possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As originally conceived by Kauffman, the adjacent possible defined all the possible chemical reactions, the total amount of combinations, that could be achieved in the primordial soup. There is a finite number of combinations that can be made, but this number grows as each new combination brings with it more possibilities.</p>
<p>The more you add to the mix, the more you remix, the more possibilities. The boundaries recede. Ideas are just like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The adjacent possible is as much about limits as it is about openings. At every moment in the timeline of an expanding biosphere, there are doors that cannot be unlocked yet.”</p>
</p>
<p>“Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn’t have reached from your original starting point.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key for all of us, then, is to expand our own adjacent possible. To keep introducing new sources, new raw material. The limit to your creative potential is what you let in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The history of life and human culture, then, can be told as the story of a gradual but relentless probing of the adjacent possible, each new innovation opening up new paths to explore.”</p>
</blockquote>
