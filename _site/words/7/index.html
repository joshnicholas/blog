<h1><a href="/words/wither-a-deviant-life/" class="post-header">Wither a deviant life</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m not really someone whose daily activities fit neatly in the guidelines. You’re probably the same. I was standing in line at the bank yesterday with a woman who is.</p><br>
<p>She needed to withdraw money. But <em>just</em> too much money to do it from an ATM. The bank, as is its wont, has invested in a battery of smart ATMs at the front of the branch. It now only staffs one of the six counters inside. The ATMs can do basically anything you would need of a teller &#8211; withdraw, move and deposit money etc.</p><br>
<p>But the ATMs have hard limits and absolutely no room for discretion.</p><br>
<p>The long line of disgruntled customers waiting to see that lonely bank teller attest to how many of us needed the flexibility of a human. Something, some<em>one</em>, who isn’t absolutely constrained by rules. Except, does this describe any of us anymore?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>…since Economic Man is incapable of being morally load-bearing, he cannot be trusted. He will only work if incentivized by material benefit, so his behaviour must be watched like a hawk, and his rewards linked to the observed performance of contract-specified actions… Britain’s employers have been taught this in business schools and the consequence is manifest in the annual Jobs and Skills Survey. Twenty-five years ago, most people said they had enough autonomy to do their job properly; that has since dropped by 40 per cent. <strong>The reduction of workers to automata</strong> has resulted in a massive loss of job satisfaction, and with it of intrinsic motivation: it is hard to be loyal to an organization that manifestly distrusts you. <strong>It has also forfeited the good judgement that comes from using tacit knowledge</strong> – the expertise that can only be acquired through experience. By definition, this cannot be codified, specified, monitored and incentivized.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/greed-is-dead/">great essay by Paul Collier</a>. And it makes me wonder what the future holds for services <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-are-the-truly-difficult-questions/">even if they aren’t</a> dominated by automation.</p><br>
<p>The metrification of daily life is well under way and is already visible in a reduction to box ticking. There is some discretion left in the world, but I have little doubt that the necessary surveillance and analytical technology will grow in leaps and bounds. The MBAs demand it.</p><br>
<p>So what does that mean for those of us who live a deviant life? Who need to withdraw <em>just</em> too much money, or otherwise travel outside the norm? Probably a lot more time on the phone, talking to similarly constrained call centre workers.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/what-are-the-truly-difficult-questions/" class="post-header">What are the truly difficult questions?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A couple of years ago I went on a three day trek that all but shattered my love of hikes. It was a hilly circuit, slippery and hot. But on the third day, as we slowly ran out of lollies, food, patience and even water; we were repeatedly greeted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_peak">false summits</a>.</p><br>
<p>The end of the trail felt like a <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/content/images/wordpress/2019/12/dogbonestick.jpeg">bone on the end of a stick</a>. Meant to trick a hungry dog. This is the image that came to mind as I read this <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/counterfactuals-and-human-progress/">next</a> grab from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/book-of-why-the-new-science-of-cause-and-effect/oclc/1106172917&#038;referer=brief_results">The Book of Why</a> by Judea Pearl.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>The successes of deep learning have been truly remarkable and have caught many of us by surprise. Nevertheless, deep learning has succeeded primarily by showing that certain questions or tasks we thought were difficult are in fact not. <strong>It has not addressed the truly difficult questions</strong> that continue to prevent us from achieving humanlike AI.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has famously had a few “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">winters</a>”, as what seemed like fundamental breakthroughs petered out. Similarly, the list of &#8220;transformational&#8221; technologies that failed to make a real dent is incredibly long.</p><br>
<p>For the non technical among us it can be very easy to mistake these kinds of false summits for fundamental transformation. Especially as they often do represent some progress. Finding themselves in products that we actually use or glimpse on breakfast television etc.</p><br>
<p>Part of the problem is framing. Especially as the incentive for so many is to hype. But it’s also a focus on outcomes rather than process.</p><br>
<p>The torture of that trek came from us focusing on the end rather than the journey. We lost track of the scenery, fresh air and each other.</p><br>
<p>We get tricked by technological false summits in the same way. By focusing so intently on what the technology can do. But the real power comes from looking at the process. Both the roadblocks and potential from questioning what the difficult questions are.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/counterfactuals-and-human-progress/" class="post-header">Counterfactuals and human progress</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The history of human progress is often viewed through significant events, movements and achievements. But what if we look at it as a story of how we think about the world?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Counterfactuals are the building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought. The ability to reflect on one’s past actions and envision alternative scenarios is the basis of free will and social responsibility. The algorithmization of counterfactuals invites thinking machines to benefit from this ability and participate in this (until now) uniquely human way of thinking about the world.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I came across these sections in the early parts of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/book-of-why-the-new-science-of-cause-and-effect/oclc/1106172917&#038;referer=brief_results">The Book of Why</a> by Judea Pearl. It&#8217;s a book on the science of causality. Here he&#8217;s exploring some of the differences between humans and the current crop of &#8220;thinking machines&#8221; &#8211; artificial intelligence and other algorithmic &#8220;learning&#8221; from data.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved counterfactuals as a rhetorical device, sort of a stripped down model. We can play with what if&#8217;s and construct something together. Try to tease out causality and significance, however elementary.</p><br>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting to consider this as a driver of human evolution. As a methodology for iteration that doesn&#8217;t appear to be possessed by other animals or modern computer models.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Within 10,000 years after the Lion Man’s creation, all other hominids (except for the very geographically isolated Flores hominids) had become extinct. And humans have continued to change the natural world with incredible speed, using our imagination to survive, adapt, and ultimately take over. <strong>The advantage we gained from imagining counterfactuals was the same then as it is today: flexibility, the ability to reflect and improve on past actions, and, perhaps even more significant, our willingness to take responsibility for past and current actions</strong>&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of us have a tendency to favour the concrete and eschew the hypothetical. But risk aversion, imagination and learning from experience &#8211; among other drivers of progress &#8211; by necessity recognise the possibility of other outcomes. They are built on counterfactual thinking.</p><br>
<p>And, maybe more interestingly when we compare human intelligence to that which we try to create, it may be somewhat innate?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Counterfactual reasoning, which deals with what-ifs, might strike some readers as unscientific. Indeed, empirical observation can never confirm or refute the answers to such questions. <strong>Yet our minds make very reliable and reproducible judgments all the time about what might be or might have been</strong>. We all understand, for instance, that had the rooster been silent this morning, the sun would have risen just as well. This consensus stems from the fact that <strong>counterfactuals are not products of whimsy but reflect the very structure of our world model</strong>.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/how-convenient-is-it-really/" class="post-header">How convenient is it really?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/dclingi/status/1195014933588664320?s=21">Twitter thread</a> last week had me wondering the most impactful thing I learned over the past decade. It is probably <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/how-little-is-too-little-overhead/">this</a> observation from Austin Kleon:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Low overhead + “do what you love” = a good life.<br />
&#8220;I deserve nice things” + “do what you love” = a time bomb.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve completely overhauled my life in the past couple of years, trying to minimise unnecessary or extravagant expenditures and commitments. I had allowed lifestyle inflation to trap me in a situation where I had to earn a certain amount. I had fallen for the advertiser&#8217;s vision of freedom and empowerment through consumption, rather than a financial, emotional and mental freedom to work on things that have impact and bring me joy.</p><br>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how I got there, as I used to break consumption down into its time value. Calculating how many hours in my minimum wage job equated to getting a couple of pizzas delivered, for instance.</p><br>
<p>I seem to have stopped this at some point, but it&#8217;s a remarkably effective way of identifying what&#8217;s worth the trouble. I came across a very stark illustration today in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-frugal-hedonism-a-guide-to-spending-less-while-enjoying-everything-more/oclc/1044562391&#038;referer=brief_results">The Art of Frugal Hedonism</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>how fast does your car really go, on average? We’re not alluding merely to time stuck in traffic here. <strong>To truly calculate the ‘effective speed’ of our vehicles we need to include all the hours we put in at the office to cover fuel, registration and other running costs</strong>… with that speedometer sitting right on zero all the while. One Australian study calculates that for every hour spent driving a Toyota Landcruiser, the average owner spends another 1.5 hours working to pay for it. The study also points out that if the owner had to pay for their car’s ‘externalities’–those costs borne by society–of CO2 emissions, traffic congestion and the cost of road accidents, they’d need to work another 0.6 hours for every hour behind the wheel. <strong>That puts the effective speed of a Landcruiser at 9 kilometres (5.7 miles) per hour</strong>. Not so convenient after all, eh? A bicycle, by the way, with its far lower purchase, running, and externality costs, clocks in at a relatively speedy 18 kilometres (11 miles) per hour.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>You could probably run similar analyses on almost any gadget or service that supposedly saves you time or adds convenience.</p><br>
<p>I, most of us probably, take our work lives as given. We <em>must</em> work full time. That gives us X dollars. Then we use those dollars as best we can to maximise the non-work hours.</p><br>
<p>But what if you reversed this? Every minute you save by owning a car (could be anything) is one you pay for with one or more minutes at work. Could you do without the car and simultaneously reduce the work? How convenient is the gadget in terms of the hours required to pay for it, purchase it, maintain it and eventually replace it?</p><br>
<p>What if you rethought both the numerator <em>and</em> the denominator?</p><br>
<p><em>As usual my emphasis</em></p><br>
