My name is Josh and I love learning. This site is about a decade old and began as a book blog but morphed into a kind of scrapbook. More recently I have been concentrating on becoming a better photographer and scribbler.<br><br>

My day job is doing data journalism at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas). Previously I was an [economics editor](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [technology journalist](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [executive producer](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) of a national current affairs radio show.<br><br>

I post a bunch of data liberated from news headlines, trending sections, stock markets and Covid stats pages on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joshnicholas). You can also follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/joshnicholas).<br><br>

Over the years this site has gone through many stylistic iterations and been ported to several different platforms and blogging tools. Some links, line breaks, quotes etc. may be broken. The current version was created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog) and uses a heavily modified fork of the [base blog template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).<br><br>

If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas).
