My name is Josh and I love to learn stuff. I am also a [data journalist](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas) and like to draw and paint. Previously I was an [economics editor](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [technology journalist](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [executive producer](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) of a national current affairs radio show.<br><br>


You can find most of my work at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas). I post a bunch of data liberated from news headlines, trending sections, stock markets and Covid stats pages on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joshnicholas). You can also follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/joshnicholas).<br><br>


This blog is a decade old now. It began as a place to post book reviews but has slowly morphed into a kind of scrapbook. A couple of years ago I added a section for photos and, more recently, scribbles. <br><br>

Over the years this site has gone through many stylistic iterations and been ported to several different platforms and blogging tools. Some links, quotes etc. may be broken. The current version was created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog) and uses a heavily modified fork of the [base blog template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).<br><br>

If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas).
