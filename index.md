My name is Josh. I love learning. It's my hobby. It's (thankfully) a large part of my job. This blog is mostly just bits and pieces from my learning process, whether it’s what I’m reading or my photos and scribbles.<br><br>

By day I am a data journalist at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas). Before that I covered [economics](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [tech](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [made some radio](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) for other outlets.<br><br>

This site is over a decade old now. It began as a book blog but morphed into a kind of scrapbook. Over the years it has gone through many stylistic iterations and blogging platforms. Some links, line breaks, quotes etc. may be broken. The current version was created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog).<br><br>

If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas).
