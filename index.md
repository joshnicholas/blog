My name is Josh. I love learning. This site is mostly just bits and pieces from my process - what Iâ€™m reading, thinking; my photos and scribbles.<br><br>

By day I am a data journalist at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas). Before that I covered [economics](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [tech](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [made some radio](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) for other outlets.<br><br>

This site is over a decade old. It began as a book blog but morphed into a kind of scrapbook. It has gone through many stylistic iterations and platforms. As a result some links, line breaks, quotes etc., may be broken. The current version was created using the [Eleventy](https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog) static site generator.<br><br>

You can also find me elsewhere on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas), [Micro.blog](https://joshnicholas.micro.blog/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/joshnicholas) and [GitHub](https://github.com/joshnicholas).
