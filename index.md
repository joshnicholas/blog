My name is Josh. I'm a [journalist](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas) and co-host a [radio show](https://radiosms.substack.com/) about the internet. Before that I was an [economics editor](https://theconversation.com/speaking-with-law-professor-cass-sunstein-on-why-behavioural-science-is-always-nudging-us-101074), [technology journalist](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/photos-inside-the-library-of-the-future-2015-12) and [executive producer](https://www.thewire.org.au/about/team/alumni/) of a national current affairs radio show.<br><br>


I'm most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home). Most of my work is on [Github](https://github.com/joshnicholas). You can also follow me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/joshnicholas).<br><br>


This blog is almost a decade old now. It began as a place to post book reviews but has slowly morphed into a kind of scrapbook. A couple of years ago I added a section for photos and, more recently, scribbles. The blog has also gone through several stylistic iterations and been ported to several different platforms and blogging tools, so some links etc. may be broken.<br><br> 

The current site was created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/joshnicholas/blog) and uses a heavily modified fork of the [base blog template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).<br><br>

I've disabled comments as I am not interested in tending a dumpster fire. If you'd like to get in touch I'd recommend Twitter.
