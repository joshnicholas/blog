<blockquote><p>“Influenza case numbers are always hard to interpret,” said Dr Rob Moss from the the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health. “They generally represent a small (but unknown) proportion of the people who have an influenza infection.”</p><br>

<p>Dr Moss said hospitalisations are a “much more stable” indicator of influenza activity. “Although it’s too early to draw any confident conclusions, FluCAN [hospital] data suggest that we’re not seeing an unprecedented number of influenza hospitalisations.”</p><br>

<p>There have been almost 90,000 confirmed cases of influenza so far this year, according to department of health data, while 700 people have been admitted to hospital since the beginning of April.</p><br>
