<blockquote><p>Set in a fictionalised version of the American heartland in 1899, the game follows one member of an outlaw gang as he negotiates morality, colonialism, the decline of the wild west, and which is the best gun to shoot a large grizzly bear with.</p><br>

<p>Like most Rockstar games, an open-world format means you are free to explore the expansive universe at your own pace and whim – making it the perfect game to disappear inside of during the long aimless hours of lockdown. – Michael McGowan</p><br>

<p>Available on: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><br>
