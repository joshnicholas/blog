<blockquote><p>Australians aged over 80 had a disproportionately high number of cases and deaths, with most of these occurring during Victoria’s extended outbreak last year.</p><br>

<p>Professor Marylouise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW, says 20-39-year-olds have been at severe risk of infection throughout the pandemic.</p><br>

<p>“We have seen young people having 40% of the burden even before Delta. They are lower socioeconomic [status]. They often work in multiple jobs or live in crowded households because they either like it or they need to do that. So it’s not a surprise that 20-39 year olds are at an enormous risk,” McLaws said.</p><br>
