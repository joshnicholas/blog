<blockquote><p>Some parts of New South Wales are projected to have less than half of their residents vaccinated against Covid when Sydney begins to reopen after reaching the statewide 70% double dose vaccination target, based on current trends.</p><br>

<p>A Guardian Australia analysis of federal Department of Health data suggests the vaccination disparity between the regions and greater Sydney will persist when the state hits 70% next month, a milestone the state government says will end stay-at-home orders for the fully jabbed.</p><br>

Separate data shows vaccination rates among national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) participants are lagging.</p><br>
