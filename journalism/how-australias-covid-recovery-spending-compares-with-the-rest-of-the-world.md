<p>Australia is firmly in the middle of the pack when it comes to Covid recovery spending, according to two projects tracking the global response. But some experts say that’s fine as the kind of stimulus programs that have been pursued in harder-hit countries weren’t needed.</p><br><br>

<p>“I think we were in dire need last year. I think we are in slightly less dire need right now because our unemployment rate has bounced back because we got it largely under control,” says University of New South Wales economics professor Richard Holden.</p><br><br>

<p>“That said, it is very clear from this budget and it is very clear from Treasury and Reserve Bank analysis of how low the unemployment rate can get before inflation really starts moving that we are going to be targeting an unemployment rate around 4% or maybe even lower ... That’s a lot of jobs that need to be created, a lot of people that need to be put to work.”</p><br><br>
