<blockquote><p>Australia’s coronavirus vaccine rollout began in late February 2021. Here we bring together the latest figures to track the progress of the rollout and Covid vaccination schedule.</p><br>

<p>The data shows the total doses given in Australia, people vaccinated in Australian states and the percentage of the population who have received one dose or are double dose fully vaccinated, as well as graphs showing daily new Covid-19 cases in Australia, deaths per day and cumulative coronavirus cases by state and territory.</p><br>

<p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br>
