<blockquote><p>The researchers note that reported shark incidents have been increasing, however, little is known about why. And some of the variation might be an artefact of how the data was collected – not all shark attacks are reported and not all reports would have been found.</p><br>

<p>The data could also be affected by increasing populations or changing social norms around things like swimming.</p><br>

<p>“Reporting over time has changed” says Dr Phoebe Meagher from Taronga Zoo.</p><br>
