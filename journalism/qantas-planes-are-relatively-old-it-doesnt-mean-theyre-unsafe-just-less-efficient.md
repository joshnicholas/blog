<blockquote><p>Qantas says the average age of its planes is now 14.7 years, a figure that has increased significantly over the past 15 years. In 2006, the average age was just over eight years and before the pandemic it was just over 11 years.</p><br>

<p>It’s also a figure that’s substantially higher than most of its competitors flying similar routes.</p><br>

<p>Dr Ian Douglas from the University of New South Wales says there are a number of causes, including a pause on orders and deliveries during the pandemic, manufacturing delays and the secondary market for certain planes.</p><br>
