<blockquote><p>The Queensland government has had the slowest vaccine rollout to date, on a per 100 population basis. It is also second last to the Northern Territory in the percentage of available vaccines actually administered.</p><br>

<p>Smaller states have managed to vaccinate a greater percentage of their citizens.</p><br>

<p>The divergence between the states and federal government-run programs started shortly after Phase 1b of the vaccine rollout began. This saw 4,600 GP clinics added to existing vaccination centres and the vaccine eligibility expanded.</p><br>
