<blockquote><p>Australia has only administered around 77% of the Covid-19 vaccines that it has received, according to the latest data from the Department of Health. But the problem is worse in some states than others, a Guardian Australia analysis shows.</p><br>

<p>The Queensland government has said it will delay opening mass vaccination hubs until the last quarter of the year, as it will no longer administer AstraZeneca vaccines. Vaccine data shows the state was already starting to fall behind other large states New South Wales and Victoria.</p><br>

<p>The Queensland government has had the slowest vaccine rollout to date, on a per 100 population basis. It is also second last to the Northern Territory in the percentage of available vaccines actually administered.</p><br>
