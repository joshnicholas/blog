<blockquote><p>Experts say Australiaâ€™s reliance on migrants to undertake essential, insecure work and a failure to engage migrant communities early in pandemic planning is a key reason for this.</p><br>

<p>The ABS data also supports previous data gathered throughout the pandemic that found deaths are higher in older populations and those with pre-existing conditions. Almost 70% of death certificates in Australia reported pre-existing chronic conditions such as dementia and diabetes, according to the data which analysed 2,639 deaths where people died with or from Covid-19 from the start of the pandemic to 31 January 2022.</p><br>

<p>The ABS expects to receive further data for this period once it receives information from the jurisdictional registries of deaths.</p><br>
