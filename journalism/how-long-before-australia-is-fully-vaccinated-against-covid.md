<p>It could take years to fully vaccinate Australia against Covid-19 unless there is a significant increase in the vaccination rate, a Guardian Australia analysis shows.</p><br>

<p>The federal government’s rollout strategy aims to administer 45m vaccine doses, not including vaccines for those aged under 18. At the seven-day rolling average of under 36,000, it could take almost 40 months to accomplish. Even a doubling of that rate wouldn’t see the rollout completed until the end of next year.</p><br>
