<blockquote><p>Israel has been a model for the vaccine rollout since the beginning, and had administered more than 60 vaccines for every 100 people at an equivalent point in its rollout to where Australia is now. The United Arab Emirates had also administered almost 60 doses per hundred.</p><br>
<p>Chile, with a population of just under 19 million people, has administered more than 12 million doses to date. At a similar point in its rollout, Chile had given out almost twice as many doses per 100 people.</p><br>
<p>However, Chile is currently experiencing a surge in new Covid cases despite its impressive vaccine rollout. This has been blamed on new strains of the virus and lack of social distancing due to the vaccine rollout. Chile is also reliant on the Sinovac vaccine from China, which may have lower efficacy than vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Pfizer.</p><br>
