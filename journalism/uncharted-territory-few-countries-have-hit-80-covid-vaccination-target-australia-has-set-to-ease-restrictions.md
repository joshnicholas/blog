<blockquote><p>At the current rate of vaccinations, Australia should hit the federal government’s 80% threshold to ease restrictions by the beginning of December. But only a few countries have reached the levels that Australia will need to – and even fewer have sustained the vaccination rate required for Australia to be done by the end of the year.</p><br>

<p>In some countries vaccinations have slowed considerably or even stalled as the total number of vaccinated people increased. Israel took just 100 days to vaccinate 55% of its entire population, but another 104 days to go from 55% to 60%.</p><br>

<p>After the “low hanging fruit” of those with pre-existing conditions, work requirements and other reasons for being prioritised, experts say it’s hard to gauge what the barriers might be to vaccinate 80% of the Australian population aged 16 and over.</p><br>
