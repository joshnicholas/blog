<blockquote><p>Bowman, an associate professor of journalism and creative media industries at Texas Tech University, has a vast collection of consoles and hundreds of cartridges and discs.</p><br>
<p>Like me, he grew up in a time when video games were intimately tied to a physical device. We played using handheld consoles, while the games themselves were on cartridges – the kind you pulled out and blew out the dust from if it wasn’t working.</p><br>
<p>As kids we spent hours immersed in gaming worlds, but when our devices were lost, broken or superseded, the game likely was too.</p><br>
