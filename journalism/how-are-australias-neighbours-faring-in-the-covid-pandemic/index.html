<p>While Australians have focused on the Covid waves in Sydney and Melbourne, many of Australia’s neighbours have recently experienced their largest outbreaks so far. This includes Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu and even Singapore.</p><br><br>
<p>Singapore surpassed Australia’s vaccination target weeks ago, but was now seeing more than a thousand cases a day. Fiji recently had one of the highest rates of Covid cases per capita – peaking at 1,850 cases in the middle of July. But the nation of 889,000 was now regularly administering more than 10,000 new vaccinations a day.</p><br><br>
<p>Vaccination rates were rising elsewhere in the region, but many of the largest countries were falling behind. At the current rate Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands may not catch up until well into 2022.</p><br><br>
