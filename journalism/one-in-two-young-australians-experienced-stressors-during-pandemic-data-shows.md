<blockquote><p>Nearly half (48.3%) of people aged 18 to 24 experienced one or more stressors during this period, which included factors such as mental ill health, job loss or being unable to get a job. In comparison, 34.8% of people aged 65 and older experienced one or more stressors.</p><br>

<p>The findings are in keeping with previous research showing young people experienced higher rates of psychological distress and educational disruption throughout the pandemic.</p><br>

<p>Separately, Australians are not eating enough fruit and vegetables, with only 6.1% of over-18s meeting the recommended daily intake.</p><br>
