<blockquote><p>The first chart shows the percentage of primary votes going to Labor and the Coalition in every election since 1949, with the most recent count from the 2022 election added at the end.</p><br>
<p>This shows the 2022 election result, with voters looking elsewhere besides the two major parties, is just the latest in a long-running trend:</p><br>
<p>In 1951, almost 98% of votes went to the two major parties. In the election just held, this number is currently down to an all-time low of 68.5%. This might change slightly as further results are counted, but itâ€™s unlikely to shift too much.</p><br>
