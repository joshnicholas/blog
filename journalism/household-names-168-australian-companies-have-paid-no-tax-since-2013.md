<blockquote><p>Previous ATO data dumps cover the period between 2013-14 and 2017-18, making it possible for Guardian Australia to determine which companies contained in the figures have not paid tax over the seven years for which numbers are available.</p><br>

<p>The companies that paid no tax over the period include household names such as property developer Lendlease and the Australian arms of multinationals including oil and gas major Chevron and German engineering and technology group Bosch.</p><br>

<p>Reasons why the companies have paid no tax vary. Some, including Lendlease, are part of property trust groups, where paying tax is the responsibility of the investor rather than the company.</p><br>
