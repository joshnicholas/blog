<blockquote><p>Associate Prof Melanie Davern, the director of the Australian Urban Observatory, says the issue is at least partly to do with how we plan our cities.</p><br>

<p>“We don’t have planners working with the health system – this is the major problem. We don’t think about an urban system. We just have a planning department, a health department and a transport department. But they are not really connected,” she says.</p><br>

<p>“Because [planning is] population based, [those outer areas] are never going to see improved access to things like GPs.”</p><br>
