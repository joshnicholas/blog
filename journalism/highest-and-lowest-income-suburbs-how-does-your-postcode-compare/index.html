<blockquote><p>Eight of the country’s highest-earning postcodes are in Sydney, according to the data, while five of the lowest-earning postcodes are based in regional New South Wales.</p><br>
<p>Western Australia’s Cottesloe and Peppermint Grove, both within the 6011 postcode, easily took first place on the list of high-income postcodes in 2019-20 with an average taxable income of $325,343.</p><br>
<p>They were followed by Sydney postcode 2027, containing the high-income suburbs of Darling Point and Edgecliff which have an average taxable income of $205,957.</p><br>
