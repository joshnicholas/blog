<p>The Omicron variant is hitting Australia much harder than previous Covid outbreaks and data from state health departments shows it is also more geographically spread.</p><br><br>

<p>Several Australian states are now seeing some of the highest case numbers in the world on a per capita basis, with some of the hardest hit local government areas (LGAs) outside of major metropolitan areas. This is true in regional New South Wales and Victoria, and is trending that way in Queensland.</p><br><br>

<p>Here we have brought together the number of cases per LGA from NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. We have excluded overseas, interstate and cases where the origin is unknown. Due to the rising number of cases and differing reporting periods for each jurisdiction the most recent day’s data may not be complete.</p><br><br>
