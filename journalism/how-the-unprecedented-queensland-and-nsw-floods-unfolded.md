<blockquote><p>The Bureau of Meteorology warns that an area of low pressure over the south coast of Queensland is dragging in moisture from the Coral Sea to the north and then lifting it over the coastline. There has been torrential rain for two days and there is much more to come.</p><br>

<p>At Gympie, 200km north of Brisbane, a flood warning is issued for the Mary River. Some areas that flow into the river have had 300mm of rain in just six hours.</p><br>

<p>Ben Domensino, a meteorologist at Weatherzone, says the low pressure trough is delivering the rainfall but an area of colder air higher in the atmosphere is drifting in, making the atmosphere unstable and allowing moisture to be lifted up and dropped as rain.</p><br>
