<blockquote><p>The past two years have also amplified other longer-term trends such as smaller household sizes, movement out of capital cities, a decreasing rental supply and pent-up demand for home ownership.</p><br>
<p>Apartment rents in some areas of metropolitan Melbourne fell almost 30% in 2020, but have since recovered almost all of that in the past 12 months, according to recent CoreLogic data. Tim Lawless, a research director at CoreLogic, says that border closures may have contributed to this initial drop due to fewer migrants, tourists and international students.</p><br>
<p>But the price recovery began well before the borders were opened as Australians chased what was now relatively affordable housing in inner cities.</p><br>
