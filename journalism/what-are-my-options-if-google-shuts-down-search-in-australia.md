<blockquote><p>But while Google can claim upwards of 90% of the search market in Australia, there are many other search options available, such as DuckDuckGo, Microsoft Bing, or Ecosia.</p><br>

<p>“Unfortunately, preparing for that worst-case scenario would result in users landing on a Google search page when they put that URL in but then being presented with a screen that tells them we’re unable to offer the service in Australia,” Silva said when asked what it meant to “stop making Google search available in Australia”.</p><br>

<p>Google has shut down services like this before. And for similar reasons. In 2014 Google shut down its News service in Spain after the government passed a law requiring Google to pay a fee for links and excerpts of news articles. Users were met with a simple message saying the service had been closed. In a similar fashion, Australians may have to change the default search engines on their phones and computers.</p><br>
