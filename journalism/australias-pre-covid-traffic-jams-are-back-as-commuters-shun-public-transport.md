<blockquote><p>University of Sydney associate professor Matthew Beck says increased working from home will probably continue for some time, meaning transport networks will need to adjust to a new normal.</p><br>

<p>Public Transport Victoria is currently seeing just more than half of its pre-Covid passenger numbers. New South Wales is faring slightly better, at just more than 62% patronage. Queensland leads the big states with more than 70% of its pre-Covid numbers.</p><br>

<p>Compared with public transport, road traffic experienced shorter and sharper dips and has recovered uniformly around the country. On movement in general, there is a clear split between urban and regional areas, with the latter recovering more and faster.</p><br>
