<blockquote><p>Guardian Australia has previously found these areas have high numbers of essential workers and a disproportionately low number of people who can work from home.</p><br>

<p>“Covid is a magnifier of inequity across cities and [is] really widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots,” RMIT Assoc Prof Melanie Davern says.</p><br>

<p>“You can see this in terms of occupations, essential working distributions, ability to work remotely, casualisation of the workforce – ie can’t afford not to go to work – decreased access to public open space and reduced liveability in local 5km neighbourhoods.”</p><br>
