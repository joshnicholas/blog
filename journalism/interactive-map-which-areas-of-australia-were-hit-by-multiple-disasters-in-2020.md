<blockquote><p>The 2019-20 fires followed several years of drought, and began in one of the driest and warmest years on record. Climate scientists have said that climate change pushed what would have been a hot year into record territory, driving heat extremes and the risk of deadly fires.</p><br>

<p>The tropical storm season also ended later than normal and, when the drought broke in some areas, flooding followed from heavy rain. On top of this, weâ€™ve had a global coronavirus pandemic that has killed 908 Australians, infected many more, and plunged the country into a recession.</p><br>

<p>This combination of events means some parts of the country have been hit by more than one disaster in a year, with some regions experiencing multiple disasters, one after the other.</p><br>
