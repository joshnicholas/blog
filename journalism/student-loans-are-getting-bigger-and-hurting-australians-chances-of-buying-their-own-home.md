<p>Data from the Australian Taxation Office shows that over the past two decades, the proportion of debts worth over $10,000 has steadily increased. In 2005, the percentage of Help debtors who owed more than $10,000 was 47.51%. It’s now more than 72%.</p><br>

<p>The proportion of debts worth more than $50,000 has also increased from 2011. The growth followed the increase in 2007 of a cap on the amount of debt a student could accumulate. The fees set by universities also increased substantially in subsequent years.</p><br>
