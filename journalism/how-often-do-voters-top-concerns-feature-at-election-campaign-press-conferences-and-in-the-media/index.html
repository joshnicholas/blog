<blockquote><p>The disconnect is stark on aged care and education. Aged care is ranked second most important by voters, but scored much lower in terms of the leaders’ releases, media coverage and questions at press conferences.</p><br>
<p>The early weeks of the campaign were also punctuated with so-called “gotcha” questions from journalists, such as Anthony Albanese being asked to name the cash rate and unemployment rate.</p><br>
<p>While the “gotcha” question might lead to headlines, how well they serve voters is questionable, and it’s possible that coverage of “gaffes” leaves less room for coverage of actual policy and topics voters genuinely care about when making the important decision on who to vote for.</p><br>
