<blockquote><p>But that fact should be considered alongside some important context.</p><br>
<p>Over the entire pandemic, Australia has one of the lowest death rates in the OECD – 439 deaths per million, the United States’s is 3,050 deaths per million and the United Kingdom 2,718.</p><br>
<p>New Zealand has seen fewer deaths than Australia – 378 per million – over the total pandemic but is currently seeing a large outbreak. Many OECD countries saw large outbreaks in 2020 and 2021, while more than half of the deaths in Australia have occurred since March.</p><br>
