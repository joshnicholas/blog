<p><p><br><center>by Stephanie Convery and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>24 February 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The local government areas of Brimbank, Greater Dandenong and Kingston accounted for 134 of the 943 Covid deaths in the state between 8 December 2021 and 21 February 2022.</p><br>
<p>Brimbank is Melbourne’s second-most disadvantaged LGA and third-most disadvantaged in the state, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), which takes into account factors such as employment, income levels, access to education, services and more.</p><br>
<p>It was also the hardest hit LGA overall in this period, with 65 deaths in total, that, when weighted for population, equates to 33.45 deaths for every 100,000 people.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/covid-death-rate-three-times-higher-among-migrants-than-those-born-in-australia/" class="post-header">Covid death rate three times higher among migrants than those born in Australia</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Melissa Davey and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>Experts say Australia’s reliance on migrants to undertake essential, insecure work and a failure to engage migrant communities early in pandemic planning is a key reason for this.</p><br>
<p>The ABS data also supports previous data gathered throughout the pandemic that found deaths are higher in older populations and those with pre-existing conditions. Almost 70% of death certificates in Australia reported pre-existing chronic conditions such as dementia and diabetes, according to the data which analysed 2,639 deaths where people died with or from Covid-19 from the start of the pandemic to 31 January 2022.</p><br>
<p>The ABS expects to receive further data for this period once it receives information from the jurisdictional registries of deaths.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Crossing the floor is rare, and only seems to be getting rarer, with a minority of federal politicians having ever crossed the floor and just a single politician involved in more than half of all floor crossing divisions between 1950 and 2019, according to data compiled by the parliamentary library.</p><br>
<p>Large defections have scuttled significant legislation before. In 2006, then prime minister John Howard was forced to drop a bill that aimed to send asylum seekers who arrived by boat to Nauru for processing. Despite three lower house MPs crossing the floor against the bill, with one abstaining, the bill made it to the Senate. But Howard was unable to secure a majority in the Senate despite the government having a slim majority of 39 (out of 76) Senate seats.</p><br>
<p>At the time, Liberal senator Judith Troeth had vowed to cross the floor against the legislation, and Nationals senator Barnaby Joyce said he planned to abstain from the vote. Troeth would also later cross the floor with senator Susan Boyce to vote in favour of Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br>
<p>The government was initially hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March 2021 and the entire country inoculated by October. Since then, goals, targets and “horizons” have come and gone.</p><br>
<p>However, in December 2021 the country had vaccinated 90% of the population aged 16 and over, and begun the rollout of boosters.</p><br>
