<p><p>Australia’s coronavirus vaccine rollout began in late February 2021. Here we bring together the latest figures to track the progress of the rollout and Covid vaccination schedule.</p><br><br>
<p>The data shows the total doses given in Australia, people vaccinated in Australian states and the percentage of the population who have received one dose or are double dose fully vaccinated, as well as graphs showing daily new Covid-19 cases in Australia, deaths per day and cumulative coronavirus cases by state and territory.</p><br><br>
<p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br><br>

<p><p>Due to the difference in reporting times between states, territories and the federal government, it can be difficult to get a current picture of how many confirmed cases of coronavirus there are in Australia, where cases are increasing or decreasing, and the overall trend for each state and territory.</p><br><br>
<p>Here, we’ve brought together all the figures in one place for Australia as a whole, as well as more information on the states with current Omicron outbreaks.</p><br><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/how-is-australias-covid-vaccine-booster-rollout-going-and-is-it-fast-enough-for-groups-that-need-it-most/" class="post-header">How is Australia’s Covid vaccine booster rollout going and is it fast enough for groups that need it most?</a></h1>




<p><p>At least 60% of Australians eligible for a Covid booster have received one, according to new government data. However, an analysis of government figures by Guardian Australia shows the booster rate could be as low as 50% once new, expanded eligibility criteria are taken into account.</p><br><br>
<p>And, despite new record highs in daily vaccinations, the rollout is still lagging at least a month behind the “ideal” schedule. This is likely due to the continued expansion of eligibility criteria by federal and state governments.</p><br><br>
<p>Here is everything we know about the progress of the booster vaccination rollout.</p><br><br>

<p><p>The last two weeks of the Omicron outbreak have been the deadliest of the entire coronavirus pandemic, with four of the five highest daily death tolls all in the past week alone, figures reveal.</p><br><br>
<p>However, despite the rising numbers, experts say we still don’t know enough about who is dying and why.</p><br><br>
<p>Here, we’ve pulled together the information we do know about deaths from various government sources.</p><br><br>
