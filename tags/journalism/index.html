<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Cait Kelly</center><br></p>
<center>28 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>But that fact should be considered alongside some important context.</p><br>
<p>Over the entire pandemic, Australia has one of the lowest death rates in the OECD – 439 deaths per million, the United States’s is 3,050 deaths per million and the United Kingdom 2,718.</p><br>
<p>New Zealand has seen fewer deaths than Australia – 378 per million – over the total pandemic but is currently seeing a large outbreak. Many OECD countries saw large outbreaks in 2020 and 2021, while more than half of the deaths in Australia have occurred since March.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Cait Kelly</center><br></p>
<center>25 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>But while hospitalisations have hit a new peak, the number of patients in intensive care is down considerably, from 420 patients in January to 161 on Monday.</p><br>
<p>New South Wales accounted for more than 2,300 of those in hospital, but the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania were hard-hit on a per capita basis, with 162 and 183 hospitalisations respectively.</p><br>
<p>Since the beginning of March, the number of patients in hospital with Covid nationwide has not dropped below 2,000.</p><br>
