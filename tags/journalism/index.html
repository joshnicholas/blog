<blockquote><p>But that fact should be considered alongside some important context.</p><br>
<p>Over the entire pandemic, Australia has one of the lowest death rates in the OECD – 439 deaths per million, the United States’s is 3,050 deaths per million and the United Kingdom 2,718.</p><br>
<p>New Zealand has seen fewer deaths than Australia – 378 per million – over the total pandemic but is currently seeing a large outbreak. Many OECD countries saw large outbreaks in 2020 and 2021, while more than half of the deaths in Australia have occurred since March.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Cait Kelly</center><br></p>
<center>25 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>But while hospitalisations have hit a new peak, the number of patients in intensive care is down considerably, from 420 patients in January to 161 on Monday.</p><br>
<p>New South Wales accounted for more than 2,300 of those in hospital, but the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania were hard-hit on a per capita basis, with 162 and 183 hospitalisations respectively.</p><br>
<p>Since the beginning of March, the number of patients in hospital with Covid nationwide has not dropped below 2,000.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>There are many reasons why Covid is spreading more “successfully”, according to Professor Maximilian de Courten, director of the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University. These include the virus mutating to spread better, the timing of vaccination drives, alongside fatigue among the public, politicians and media for preventative measures such as wearing face masks.</p><br>
<p>For most of the pandemic, Australia had far fewer hospitalisations and deaths than comparable countries. Some OECD countries have seen double or even triple the number of hospitalisations per million as Australia’s peak. Until the Delta wave in late 2021, Australia was one of few countries with fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than would be expected based on previous trends, known as “excess deaths”.</p><br>
<p>New Zealand is now the only country in the OECD with negative excess deaths, according to a model created by the Economist. Based on current trends that might not last long.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/how-we-used-machine-learning-to-cover-the-australian-election/" class="post-header">Australian data team blog  How we used machine learning to cover the Australian election</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Nick Evershed and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>15 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>All up, we processed 34,061 Facebook posts, 2,452 media releases, and published eight stories (eg here, here and here) in addition to an interactive feature. We also used the same Facebook data to analyse photos posted during the campaign to break down the most common types of photo ops for each party, and how things have changed since the 2016 election.</p><br>
<p>We were able to discover more than 1,600 election promises, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in potential spending. Our textual analysis later found almost 200 (112 in marginal seats) of the Coalition’s promises were explicitly conditional on their winning the election. This means much of the targeted-largesse may never have been widely known without our project.</p><br>
<p>Teasing out a few hundred election promises from millions and millions of words is like finding a needle in a haystack, and would have been otherwise impossible for our small team in such a short time frame without making use of machine learning.</p><br>
