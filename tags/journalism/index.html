<blockquote><p>One Nation had the strongest swing of any party with a policy against vaccine mandates, boosting their first preferences by 1.8% – in part due to running more candidates this time. Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party had a 0.7% towards them. That compares to the Greens which gained 1.5% more first preferences, while the major parties suffered a combined swing against them of just over 6%. Independents upped their share of first preferences by 2%.</p><br>
<p>Looking only at the seats One Nation contested in 2019, the party lost vote share in two-thirds of those electorates. The United Australia Party improved its position in two-thirds of the seats it ran in.</p><br>
<p>Dr Josh Roose, senior research fellow at Deakin University, told Guardian Australia that the anti-vaccination population was quite small, but when viewed as part of a broader sense of disaffection with politics and the main parties, there was a worrying trend.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Neural networks? Generating images from text? So, like, you plug ‘Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner’ into a computer and it spits out pictures of … that?</p><br>
<p>You aren’t thinking outside the box enough! Sure, you can create all the Kermit images you want. But the reason you’re hearing about AI art is because of the ability to create images from ideas no one has ever expressed before. If you do a Google search for “a kangaroo made of cheese” you won’t really find anything. But here’s nine of them generated by a model.</p><br>
<p>You mentioned that it’s all a load of maths before, but – putting it as simply as you can – how does it actually work?</p><br>

<blockquote><p>The major parties also received their lowest recorded first preference vote, continuing a downward trend that stretches back decades.</p><br>
<p>Using data from the Australian Electoral Commission and our seat explorer, Guardian Australia has crunched the numbers to help explain the election result. The seat results are based on predictions and, as of writing, none of these seats have been officially declared by the AEC.</p><br>
<p>The Coalition lost 18 seats, 10 went to Labor and six to independents. The Greens picked up three seats in Queensland, two from the Coalition and one from Labor.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed</center><br></p>
<center>27 May 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The first chart shows the percentage of primary votes going to Labor and the Coalition in every election since 1949, with the most recent count from the 2022 election added at the end.</p><br>
<p>This shows the 2022 election result, with voters looking elsewhere besides the two major parties, is just the latest in a long-running trend:</p><br>
<p>In 1951, almost 98% of votes went to the two major parties. In the election just held, this number is currently down to an all-time low of 68.5%. This might change slightly as further results are counted, but it’s unlikely to shift too much.</p><br>
