<blockquote><p>We were already using machine learning to flag text from politicians’ Facebook posts as likely grant announcements and election promises, but having another model in place to find big cheques and certificates in photos might pick up things we’d missed in the text.</p><br>
<p>Giant cheques have made news in previous years – in 2019 when the former Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, presented a grant to a bowling club despite this practice usually being the domain of the sitting MP. A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a $23m grant for Rockhampton stadium.</p><br>
<p>With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/how-often-do-voters-top-concerns-feature-at-election-campaign-press-conferences-and-in-the-media/" class="post-header">How often do voters’ top concerns feature at election campaign press conferences and in the media?</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed and Khaled Al Khawaldeh</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>The disconnect is stark on aged care and education. Aged care is ranked second most important by voters, but scored much lower in terms of the leaders’ releases, media coverage and questions at press conferences.</p><br>
<p>The early weeks of the campaign were also punctuated with so-called “gotcha” questions from journalists, such as Anthony Albanese being asked to name the cash rate and unemployment rate.</p><br>
<p>While the “gotcha” question might lead to headlines, how well they serve voters is questionable, and it’s possible that coverage of “gaffes” leaves less room for coverage of actual policy and topics voters genuinely care about when making the important decision on who to vote for.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/only-8-of-candidates-in-the-federal-election-come-from-diverse-backgrounds/" class="post-header">Only 8% of candidates in the federal election come from diverse backgrounds</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>16 May 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Less than 40% (458) of House candidates are women, with the majority of both diverse and female candidates running as challengers in safe or fairly safe seats.</p><br>
<p>The most commonly self-identified occupations of House candidates – aside from existing members of parliament – are managers, retirees and businesspeople. Some unique occupations listed by only a single candidate include a showman, firearms dealer, humanitarian and a carbon farmer.</p><br>
<p>Although the lists are largely crowdsourced via public statements and may not be comprehensive, as the Australian Electoral Commission does not release extensive data on candidates’ backgrounds, they nevertheless highlight a troubling lack of diversity in the electionwhich “is not representative of multicultural Australia”.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Katharine Murphy and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>This is a central campaign conundrum – how do political parties speak successfully to all relevant audiences? In Australia, major-party campaigns are drawing more extensively on data to help with election narrowcasting and micro-targeting, especially in targeted seats. One of the fundamentals in successful political engagement and communication is knowing who you are speaking to, what has shaped them and what matters to them.</p><br>
<p>Guardian Australia’s election Seat Explorer allows us to explore the incredible diversity of languages, religions and countries of birth across the 151 House of Representatives electorates.</p><br>
<p>Unfortunately, the data from the 2021 census has not yet been released, so Guardian Australia partnered with academics from Griffith University to adjust the 2016 census data for the latest electoral boundaries.</p><br>
