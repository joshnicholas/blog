<blockquote><p>When I was a kid, my grandma took me to visit Senaka Senanayake, a famous Sri Lankan artist. I gazed up at the walls of his house in central Colombo, plastered with his colourful drawings and paintings. Many of them were decades old, from when Senaka was a child prodigy.</p><br>
<p>For years I thought all artists were like that – imbued with some gift the rest of us were denied. But I’ve come to realise that while I may never become Senaka, I can always get closer.</p><br>
<p>My early drawings were flat objects plonked on the page, with little internal relation or coherence. They were also a mashup of what I was trying to draw and my preconceived notions. A tree became a weird mixture of the tree in front of me and every other tree I’d ever seen.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Eight of the country’s highest-earning postcodes are in Sydney, according to the data, while five of the lowest-earning postcodes are based in regional New South Wales.</p><br>
<p>Western Australia’s Cottesloe and Peppermint Grove, both within the 6011 postcode, easily took first place on the list of high-income postcodes in 2019-20 with an average taxable income of $325,343.</p><br>
<p>They were followed by Sydney postcode 2027, containing the high-income suburbs of Darling Point and Edgecliff which have an average taxable income of $205,957.</p><br>
