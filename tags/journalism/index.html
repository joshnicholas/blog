<blockquote><p>Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</p><br>
<p>Data from the Australian Taxation Office shows that over the past two decades, the proportion of debts worth over $10,000 has steadily increased. In 2005, the percentage of Help debtors who owed more than $10,000 was 47.51%. It’s now more than 72%.</p><br>
<p>The proportion of debts worth more than $50,000 has also increased from 2011. The growth followed the increase in 2007 of a cap on the amount of debt a student could accumulate. The fees set by universities also increased substantially in subsequent years.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>Here, we take a look at where the highest concentration of Airbnb properties are, where rents have spiked the most, and which areas had the highest amount of vacant properties on census night, and if any of these three are correlated.</p><br>
<p>Broadly speaking, experts say there are a number of factors that could be affecting short-term rental, rent prices and empty properties.</p><br>
<p>“There is of course concern with rents going up at the moment, but the evidence shows there’s a bunch of reasons for that. Housing construction during the pandemic did not keep up with demand,” says Dr Thomas Sigler, an urban and economic geographer from the University of Queensland.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>When I was a kid, my grandma took me to visit Senaka Senanayake, a famous Sri Lankan artist. I gazed up at the walls of his house in central Colombo, plastered with his colourful drawings and paintings. Many of them were decades old, from when Senaka was a child prodigy.</p><br>
<p>For years I thought all artists were like that – imbued with some gift the rest of us were denied. But I’ve come to realise that while I may never become Senaka, I can always get closer.</p><br>
<p>My early drawings were flat objects plonked on the page, with little internal relation or coherence. They were also a mashup of what I was trying to draw and my preconceived notions. A tree became a weird mixture of the tree in front of me and every other tree I’d ever seen.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Eight of the country’s highest-earning postcodes are in Sydney, according to the data, while five of the lowest-earning postcodes are based in regional New South Wales.</p><br>
<p>Western Australia’s Cottesloe and Peppermint Grove, both within the 6011 postcode, easily took first place on the list of high-income postcodes in 2019-20 with an average taxable income of $325,343.</p><br>
<p>They were followed by Sydney postcode 2027, containing the high-income suburbs of Darling Point and Edgecliff which have an average taxable income of $205,957.</p><br>
