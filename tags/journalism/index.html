<blockquote><p>“Influenza case numbers are always hard to interpret,” said Dr Rob Moss from the the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health. “They generally represent a small (but unknown) proportion of the people who have an influenza infection.”</p><br>
<p>Dr Moss said hospitalisations are a “much more stable” indicator of influenza activity. “Although it’s too early to draw any confident conclusions, FluCAN [hospital] data suggest that we’re not seeing an unprecedented number of influenza hospitalisations.”</p><br>
<p>There have been almost 90,000 confirmed cases of influenza so far this year, according to department of health data, while 700 people have been admitted to hospital since the beginning of April.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/one-in-two-young-australians-experienced-stressors-during-pandemic-data-shows/" class="post-header">One in two young Australians experienced stressors during pandemic, data shows</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Donna Lu and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>17 June 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Nearly half (48.3%) of people aged 18 to 24 experienced one or more stressors during this period, which included factors such as mental ill health, job loss or being unable to get a job. In comparison, 34.8% of people aged 65 and older experienced one or more stressors.</p><br>
<p>The findings are in keeping with previous research showing young people experienced higher rates of psychological distress and educational disruption throughout the pandemic.</p><br>
<p>Separately, Australians are not eating enough fruit and vegetables, with only 6.1% of over-18s meeting the recommended daily intake.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/anti-vax-mandate-policies-prove-to-be-no-vote-winner-with-australians-this-time/" class="post-header">Anti-vax mandate policies prove to be no vote winner with Australians – this time</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>One Nation had the strongest swing of any party with a policy against vaccine mandates, boosting their first preferences by 1.8% – in part due to running more candidates this time. Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party had a 0.7% towards them. That compares to the Greens which gained 1.5% more first preferences, while the major parties suffered a combined swing against them of just over 6%. Independents upped their share of first preferences by 2%.</p><br>
<p>Looking only at the seats One Nation contested in 2019, the party lost vote share in two-thirds of those electorates. The United Australia Party improved its position in two-thirds of the seats it ran in.</p><br>
<p>Dr Josh Roose, senior research fellow at Deakin University, told Guardian Australia that the anti-vaccination population was quite small, but when viewed as part of a broader sense of disaffection with politics and the main parties, there was a worrying trend.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Neural networks? Generating images from text? So, like, you plug ‘Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner’ into a computer and it spits out pictures of … that?</p><br>
<p>You aren’t thinking outside the box enough! Sure, you can create all the Kermit images you want. But the reason you’re hearing about AI art is because of the ability to create images from ideas no one has ever expressed before. If you do a Google search for “a kangaroo made of cheese” you won’t really find anything. But here’s nine of them generated by a model.</p><br>
<p>You mentioned that it’s all a load of maths before, but – putting it as simply as you can – how does it actually work?</p><br>
