<blockquote><p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br>
<p>The government was initially hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March 2021 and the entire country inoculated by October. Since then, goals, targets and “horizons” have come and gone.</p><br>
<p>However, in December 2021 the country had vaccinated 90% of the population aged 16 and over, and begun the rollout of boosters.</p><br>

<p>Here you can see a summary of the overall situation, including the current status of the Covid vaccine booster rollout. For more information about vaccinations, you can check out our dedicated vaccine rollout page.</p><br>
<p>This chart shows the number of Covid cases announced daily, for all of Australia. Unlike some of the other charts on this page it does not distinguish between cases reported from rapid antigen tests (RAT) and cases reported from PCR tests, and does not backdate RAT case numbers.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed</center><br></p>
<center>29 January 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Here is everything we know about the progress of the booster vaccination rollout.</p><br>
<p>Data from the health department, released in response to questions from Guardian Australia, shows 60% of eligible Australians aged 18 and over have received a booster, with the rate rising for those in older age groups:</p><br>
<p>The government has not been publishing booster numbers by age in its regular vaccination updates. Tracking the rollout of boosters in the older population is important as older people are more likely to die, or require treatment in an intensive care unit than younger people.</p><br>

<center>21 January 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Here, we’ve pulled together the information we do know about deaths from various government sources.</p><br>
<p>The data shows that for Australia’s third large Covid wave, older Australians continue to be overrepresented in the death toll, even as younger Australians record far more cases.</p><br>
<p>And in New South Wales, where more detailed data is available, the protective effect of vaccines remains clear, with serious outcomes – deaths and ICU admission – far less likely for vaccinated people with Covid, across every age group.</p><br>
