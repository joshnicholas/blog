<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>01 June 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The major parties also received their lowest recorded first preference vote, continuing a downward trend that stretches back decades.</p><br>
<p>Using data from the Australian Electoral Commission and our seat explorer, Guardian Australia has crunched the numbers to help explain the election result. The seat results are based on predictions and, as of writing, none of these seats have been officially declared by the AEC.</p><br>
<p>The Coalition lost 18 seats, 10 went to Labor and six to independents. The Greens picked up three seats in Queensland, two from the Coalition and one from Labor.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>The first chart shows the percentage of primary votes going to Labor and the Coalition in every election since 1949, with the most recent count from the 2022 election added at the end.</p><br>
<p>This shows the 2022 election result, with voters looking elsewhere besides the two major parties, is just the latest in a long-running trend:</p><br>
<p>In 1951, almost 98% of votes went to the two major parties. In the election just held, this number is currently down to an all-time low of 68.5%. This might change slightly as further results are counted, but it’s unlikely to shift too much.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/reality-cheque-we-taught-ai-artificial-intelligence-to-spot-the-most-used-props-australian-federal-election-2022/" class="post-header">Reality cheque - we taught AI to spot the most used props this election. Here’s what it found</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Nick Evershed and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>

<blockquote><p>We were already using machine learning to flag text from politicians’ Facebook posts as likely grant announcements and election promises, but having another model in place to find big cheques and certificates in photos might pick up things we’d missed in the text.</p><br>
<p>Giant cheques have made news in previous years – in 2019 when the former Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, presented a grant to a bowling club despite this practice usually being the domain of the sitting MP. A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a $23m grant for Rockhampton stadium.</p><br>
<p>With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/how-often-do-voters-top-concerns-feature-at-election-campaign-press-conferences-and-in-the-media/" class="post-header">How often do voters’ top concerns feature at election campaign press conferences and in the media?</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed and Khaled Al Khawaldeh</center><br></p>
<center>17 May 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The disconnect is stark on aged care and education. Aged care is ranked second most important by voters, but scored much lower in terms of the leaders’ releases, media coverage and questions at press conferences.</p><br>
<p>The early weeks of the campaign were also punctuated with so-called “gotcha” questions from journalists, such as Anthony Albanese being asked to name the cash rate and unemployment rate.</p><br>
<p>While the “gotcha” question might lead to headlines, how well they serve voters is questionable, and it’s possible that coverage of “gaffes” leaves less room for coverage of actual policy and topics voters genuinely care about when making the important decision on who to vote for.</p><br>
