<blockquote><p>Crossing the floor is rare, and only seems to be getting rarer, with a minority of federal politicians having ever crossed the floor and just a single politician involved in more than half of all floor crossing divisions between 1950 and 2019, according to data compiled by the parliamentary library.</p><br>
<p>Large defections have scuttled significant legislation before. In 2006, then prime minister John Howard was forced to drop a bill that aimed to send asylum seekers who arrived by boat to Nauru for processing. Despite three lower house MPs crossing the floor against the bill, with one abstaining, the bill made it to the Senate. But Howard was unable to secure a majority in the Senate despite the government having a slim majority of 39 (out of 76) Senate seats.</p><br>
<p>At the time, Liberal senator Judith Troeth had vowed to cross the floor against the legislation, and Nationals senator Barnaby Joyce said he planned to abstain from the vote. Troeth would also later cross the floor with senator Susan Boyce to vote in favour of Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><br>
<p>The government was initially hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March 2021 and the entire country inoculated by October. Since then, goals, targets and “horizons” have come and gone.</p><br>
<p>However, in December 2021 the country had vaccinated 90% of the population aged 16 and over, and begun the rollout of boosters.</p><br>

<blockquote><p>Here is everything we know about the progress of the booster vaccination rollout.</p><br>
<p>Data from the health department, released in response to questions from Guardian Australia, shows 60% of eligible Australians aged 18 and over have received a booster, with the rate rising for those in older age groups:</p><br>
<p>The government has not been publishing booster numbers by age in its regular vaccination updates. Tracking the rollout of boosters in the older population is important as older people are more likely to die, or require treatment in an intensive care unit than younger people.</p><br>
