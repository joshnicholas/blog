<blockquote><p>There are many reasons why Covid is spreading more “successfully”, according to Professor Maximilian de Courten, director of the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University. These include the virus mutating to spread better, the timing of vaccination drives, alongside fatigue among the public, politicians and media for preventative measures such as wearing face masks.</p><br>
<p>For most of the pandemic, Australia had far fewer hospitalisations and deaths than comparable countries. Some OECD countries have seen double or even triple the number of hospitalisations per million as Australia’s peak. Until the Delta wave in late 2021, Australia was one of few countries with fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than would be expected based on previous trends, known as “excess deaths”.</p><br>
<p>New Zealand is now the only country in the OECD with negative excess deaths, according to a model created by the Economist. Based on current trends that might not last long.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/journalism/how-we-used-machine-learning-to-cover-the-australian-election/" class="post-header">Australian data team blog  How we used machine learning to cover the Australian election</a></h1>




<p><p><br><center>by Nick Evershed and Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>15 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>All up, we processed 34,061 Facebook posts, 2,452 media releases, and published eight stories (eg here, here and here) in addition to an interactive feature. We also used the same Facebook data to analyse photos posted during the campaign to break down the most common types of photo ops for each party, and how things have changed since the 2016 election.</p><br>
<p>We were able to discover more than 1,600 election promises, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in potential spending. Our textual analysis later found almost 200 (112 in marginal seats) of the Coalition’s promises were explicitly conditional on their winning the election. This means much of the targeted-largesse may never have been widely known without our project.</p><br>
<p>Teasing out a few hundred election promises from millions and millions of words is like finding a needle in a haystack, and would have been otherwise impossible for our small team in such a short time frame without making use of machine learning.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>06 July 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>The researchers note that reported shark incidents have been increasing, however, little is known about why. And some of the variation might be an artefact of how the data was collected – not all shark attacks are reported and not all reports would have been found.</p><br>
<p>The data could also be affected by increasing populations or changing social norms around things like swimming.</p><br>
<p>“Reporting over time has changed” says Dr Phoebe Meagher from Taronga Zoo.</p><br>

<p><p><br><center>by Josh Nicholas</center><br></p>
<center>26 June 2022</center><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Associate Prof Melanie Davern, the director of the Australian Urban Observatory, says the issue is at least partly to do with how we plan our cities.</p><br>
<p>“We don’t have planners working with the health system – this is the major problem. We don’t think about an urban system. We just have a planning department, a health department and a transport department. But they are not really connected,” she says.</p><br>
<p>“Because [planning is] population based, [those outer areas] are never going to see improved access to things like GPs.”</p><br>
