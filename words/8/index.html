<h1><a href="/words/searching-for-some-intelligence/" class="post-header">Searching for some intelligence</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We’re pretty well in to the internet age. But how much do our perceptions, selection and judgement reflect that?</p><br>
<p>Is the smartest person you know the one with the deepest personal repository of knowledge? Or the one with the widest knowledge, armed with the tools and skills to find out anything?</p><br>
<p>Are there many pub trivia nights that arm patrons with the web to hunt down obscure clues or answers?</p><br>
<p>I’ve been thinking of this as I get stuck into my latest coding textbook, the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/python-data-science-handbook-essential-tools-for-working-with-data/oclc/967515269">Python Data Science Handbook</a>. Early on author Jake VanderPlas writes:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>When a technologically minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and Stack Overflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. <strong>Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know</strong>, whether through a web search engine or another means.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely this goes for most things. Knowledge itself isn’t redundant, obviously. It’s experience, information and skills that inform how and where you search, and what for.</p><br>
<p>But, at the same time, it feels like we’re still living with an outdated perception of intelligence. Intelligence as a kind of isolated store of information that can’t be updated or augmented mid-problem.</p><br>
<p>I’m waiting to see a job ad that’s looking for a candidate that isn’t just qualified, but has skills to locate, store and retrieve appropriate information. Better yet, emphasises that.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/beware-the-cynicism/" class="post-header">Beware the cynicism</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve not really protested much in my life. I&#8217;ve always found them quite pointless.</p><br>
<p>As a signalling device protests are quite lacking. No matter the size it&#8217;s only a subset of the population. This isn&#8217;t too meaningful as there&#8217;s an equally large, rabid subset of the population that believe anything and everything.</p><br>
<p>Grouping the most motivated people together isn&#8217;t a great signal either of larger animation or changing tides. It&#8217;s about as convincing as pointing to the membership of any one political party and using that as justification for a policy position.</p><br>
<p>Similarly, even the most well attended protest is unlikely to contain the voting population required to swing a seat. Constituencies represented by politicians who already agree are likely over-represented among protesters. The rest are likely spread so thin among constituencies as to not constitute a meaningful margin.</p><br>
<p>But it&#8217;s questionable how much my cynicism could also be the result of manipulation. Again from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/this-is-not-propaganda-adventures-in-the-war-against-reality/oclc/1117637712&#038;referer=brief_results">This Is Not Propaganda</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that <strong>they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative</strong>, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’&#8230;</p><br>
<p>&#8230;And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that <strong>you, the little guy, can never change anything</strong>. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular passage is obviously talking about the &#8220;deep state&#8221; end of the spectrum. But the overall notion still holds. Cynicism can be fostered. And the fruitlessness it engenders can be an impediment to political action. Don&#8217;t suppress yourself.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/pumping-out-the-noise/" class="post-header">Pumping out the noise</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Increasingly, staying informed is a struggle to separate the signal from the noise. The declining cost and returns from content have led much traditional media to resort to pumping stuff out. Rather than the good ideas beating the bad ones in a marketplace of ideas, it&#8217;s more islands of quality surrounded by oceans of dross.</p><br>
<p>An interesting observation early on in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/this-is-not-propaganda-adventures-in-the-war-against-reality/oclc/1117637712&#038;referer=brief_results">This Is Not Propaganda</a> is how bad actors have leveraged this same phenomena, deliberately, as a form of censorship. We&#8217;re used to thinking of censorship as the removal, absence of blacking-out of information, but drowning it out is just as effective.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;More information was supposed to mean more freedom to stand up to the powerful, but it’s also given them new ways to crush and silence dissent. More information was supposed to mean a more informed debate, but we seem less capable of deliberation than ever. More information was supposed to mean mutual understanding across borders, but it has also made possible new and more subtle forms of conflict and subversion. <strong>We live in a world of mass persuasion run amok</strong>&#8230;&#8221;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>As Donald Trump shows constantly, this is something for which we are wholly unprepared. Our information environment is built on filters and assumptions of good faith that no longer exist or are now undercapitalised.</p><br>
<p>Shamelessness, trolling and coordinated disinformation campaigns usurp our models.</p><br>
<p>Just this week the Australian press has launched a campaign against excessive national security legislative by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B33WHa9p76R/?igshid=1d2ybhs0ehbk9">blacking out their front pages</a>. But are we so focused on a loss of access, a lack of information, that we&#8217;re missing the inverse?</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered in February 2015, for instance, assassinated with a Makarov pistol on a bridge right underneath the towers and onion domes of Red Square, the farm’s middle management suddenly started running into every office, giving the trolls direct instructions on what to post under which articles printed in mainstream Russian publications. The farm was working in rhythm with the whole government disinformation complex. No one had time to read the articles, but they knew exactly what to post. <strong>The trolls were told to spread confusion about who was behind the murder</strong>: was it the Ukrainians, the Chechens, the Americans? The IRA, an agency whose connection to the Kremlin was purposefully blurred, was in turn purposefully blurring the Kremlin’s connection to a murder.&#8221;</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/are-there-fundamental-limits/" class="post-header">Are there fundamental limits?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Looking through history, especially the history of thought, you often come across pronouncements of profound limitations. Only for a paradigm shift to leave these notions in the dust.</p><br>
<p>The “Malthusian Trap” may be the best example of this. It shows how easy it is to get caught in modern paradigms, extrapolating only from what is currently possible or emphasised.</p><br>
<p>But are these limits always transitory, or can they actually be more fundamental?</p><br>
<p>I’ve been wondering this after a <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/vaclav-smil-on-the-need-to-abandon-growth.html">recent interview</a> where Vaclav Smil posits that we are on the cusp of the limits of energy efficiency:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the fundamentals of human existence, the yield of crops, the energy which we save by making materials, the energy we save by making better converters, no matter if it’s turbines, or cars, all these things which run our economy are basically improving at a rate of one, or two, or at best about 3 percent a year&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It’s actually becoming more and more difficult to wring out even those 3 percent, because there are many things here. We are approaching thermodynamic or straight pneumatic limits with many of these things. This idea of dematerialization, decreasing the energy intensity — fine, you can keep doing it, but you cannot do it forever. If I built a house, I can make it lighter, but I will still need some steel, some lumber, some tiles, some glass. I cannot make it not using material. This is another kind of false god — dematerialization and decrease of energy efficiency. <strong>Energy efficiency is helpful, it’s happening all the time, but it has its own thermodynamic and material limits</strong>.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we simply innovate our way past continued consumption growth and trust compounding efficiency to make up the difference? Or are we up against something more fundamental?</p><br>
