<h1><a href="/words/the-world-doesnt-fit-in-neat-boxes/" class="post-header">The world doesnt fit in neat boxes</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I wanted to add to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/nothing-is-obvious/">something I just wrote about</a> – the construction of our realities. It’s a topic much enriched by Gillian Tett’s brilliant book, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Silo-Effect-Gillian-Tett/9781844087587/?a_aid=thambili">The Silo Effect</a>.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
…humans always assume that the way that they organize the world around them is entirely natural and inevitable.
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>So, Tett’s book is primarily a reaction to the Global Financial Crisis. An anthropologist by training, she started to question why traders in the same bank were making opposing bets, how risk analysts could have been so blissfully unaware of the downside of some of these trades, and how economists and regulators missed the forrest for the trees.</p><br>
<p>The answer, she claims, is our unfortunate tendency to break the world down into neat little boxes. This can be effective, and even necessary, in our taking in and understanding the world. But the siloisation of expertise, information and people can be dangerous.</p><br>
<p>And it’s also not very accurate.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
A common theme of anthropological research is that the way we classify the world never really matches the reality of our environments. People might draw neat diagrams of their kinship structures and family trees, but there are often ambiguities, overlaps, and underlaps. Things fall between the cracks. Life does not always fit into the official descriptions of what people are supposed to do. Much of the time we ignore these messy realities. It feels easier to stick with the neat classification systems we have than constantly rewrite them, be that in the sphere of kinship, religion, domestic life, or anything else.
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>If you watched any of this year’s campaign coverage, this should be familiar to you. Analysts broke America down into categories – white voters, women voters, black voters, latino voters, rural voters, working class voters; they ascribed motivations and prescribed answers.</p><br>
<p>But the world doesn’t want to conform to our little boxes. When it comes to institutions this can cause confusion, blindness and infighting. And, guess what, it does that in politics too. Maybe it’s time to question the boxes.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
…the conventions that we use to classify the world are often not officially defined or spelled out. Instead, they arise out of a dense set of rules, traditions, and conventions that we have absorbed from our surroundings, often in an unthinking way.

<h1><a href="/words/nothing-is-obvious/" class="post-header">Nothing is obvious</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Like many, I’ve spent in the last few days in a state of disbelief. How could Donald Trump win? I was certain it wouldn’t happen. Not based on polls or probabilistic models, but my perception of the way the world works.</p><br>
<p>Trump just doesn’t get elected in a country with well-developed institutions, I thought. This is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa">something that happens in Sri Lanka</a>.</p><br>
<p>It’s this sense of certainty that I now find most interesting. It was <em>obvious</em> to me that Trump would not win. And this was shared by everyone I spoke to, both before and after the event.</p><br>
<p>But this certainty, especially this shared sense of the obvious, is a problem. As explained by Dave Gray in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liminal-Thinking-Create-Change-Changing/dp/1933820462">Liminal Thinking</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The obvious is not obvious. It is constructed. We work together, as individuals and in groups, to construct the obvious every day. We band together in “obvious clubs” that defend competing versions of reality. When you walk into your obvious club, you will find people reading the same books, watching the same news channels, and talking to the same people, all of which tends to reinforce the same version of reality.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of reality as a construct is not new. We filter our world through a lense, one made up of our experiences and beliefs. But the idea of a mutually constructed obvious – what one might call <em>common sense</em> – rather than an inherited or inherent one, is a new framing for me.</p><br>
<p>And this rings especially true as I think back on my many conversations about this election. So many of which were kicked off by the realisation we had read the same article or listened to the same podcast. It wasn’t just that my friends and I arrived at the election from the same place – as outsiders looking in. We were searching for bricks and gluing them together in our conversations.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think something is obvious, that’s an idea that bears closer examination. Why do you think it’s obvious? What personal experiences have you had that led to that belief? Can you imagine a different set of experiences that might lead to a different belief?</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a whole bunch of people taking a hard look at their priors right now, talking about breaking outside their bubbles. This is where you should start. There is no inherent obvious.</p><br>
