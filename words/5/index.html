<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If you have thought seriously about inequality or capitalism then the thesis of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/code-of-capital-how-the-law-createswealth-and-inequality/oclc/1107153270&#038;referer=brief_results">The code of capital</a> by Katharina Pistor is not going to be too shocking. Still, it&#8217;s one of the best articulated explanations for wealth and inequality I&#8217;ve seen.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Fundamentally, capital is made from two ingredients: an asset, and the legal code. I use the term “asset” broadly to denote any object, claim, skill, or idea, regardless of its form. In their unadulterated appearance, these simple assets are just that: a piece of dirt, a building, a promise to receive payment at a future date, an idea for a new drug, or a string of digital code. <strong>With the right legal coding, any of these assets can be turned into capital and thereby increase its propensity to create wealth for its holder(s)</strong>&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives you the crux of the argument. That how assets are turned into capital, and so generate wealth and confer certain rights, is contrived. This may seem like a simplistic and obvious point, but we often take for granted what protections are afforded to certain assets, why some stakeholders are held over others, or the myriad frameworks and legal fictions we use to interact with them.</p><br>
<p>Who decides this, and why, helps explain persistent and widening inequality in many societies.</p><br>
<p>The idea that people aren&#8217;t all equal before the law isn&#8217;t a novel concept. Nor is the notion that the already wealthy and powerful have greater ability to influence this. But Pistor makes a more subtle point.</p><br>
<p>She focuses on how private agents, through private law, have taken over this process. Lawyers, not legislators, conform assets to the law, and select and fashion the law to suit.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Law is the cloth from which capital is cut; it gives holders of capital assets the right to exclusive use and to the future returns on their assets; it allows capital to rule not by force, but by law. <strong>The cloth is woven of private law, of contracts, property rights, trust, corporate, and bankruptcy law, the modules of the code of capital</strong>. Capital owes its vibrancy and frequent transmutations (from land, to firms, to debt, to ideas, etc.) to the fact that private and not state actors code capital in law.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>In that sense the issue is less about access to legislators and more about access to smart and creative lawyers. Especially interesting is how Pistor frames this as an implicit subsidy to those able to play the game.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Subsidies and other “entitlements” are typically viewed with great suspicion, because they are regarded as distortive of markets and lead to inefficiencies, even corruption. Yet, <strong>the legal protections capital enjoys are arguably the mother of all subsidies</strong>. Without the code’s modules and the possibility to fashion them to one’s liking, neither capital nor capitalism would exist.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>What Pistor reveals is a deeper problem than is acknowledged by calls for higher taxes, different tax treatment, greater transfers, or pretty much anything else intended to decrease inequality. This is a structural issue, an invisible force behind much of our lives. It&#8217;s about who gets to set the rules behind closed doors.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Realizing the centrality and power of law for coding capital has important implications for understanding the political economy of capitalism. <strong>It shifts attention from class identity and class struggle to the question of who has access to and control over the legal code and its masters</strong>: the landed elites; the long-distance traders and merchant banks; the shareholders of corporations that own production facilities or simply hold assets behind a corporate veil; the banks who grant loans, issue credit cards, and student loans; and the non-bank financial intermediaries that issue complex financial assets, including asset-backed securities and derivatives&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The law is a powerful tool for social ordering and, if used wisely, has the potential to serve a broad range of social objectives; yet&#8230; the law has been placed firmly in the service of capital.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/bring-on-the-cyborgs/" class="post-header">Bring on the cyborgs</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the most interesting observations in <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/no-solution-is-perfect/">Radical Markets</a> is that artificial intelligence is (at least currently) beholden to the labour of humans. AI requires us to produce, and even process and mark up, the data used to train them:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;AIs are not actually the free-standing replacement for human labor they appear to be. <strong>They are trained with and learn from human data</strong>. Thus AI, just as much as fields or factories, <strong>offers a critical role for ordinary human labor—as suppliers of data</strong>, or what we will call data as labor. Failing to recognize data as labor could thus create what Lanier calls “fake unemployment,” where jobs dry up not because humans are not useful but because the valuable inputs they supply are treated as by-products of entertainment rather than as socially valued work.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This questions the fear that humans are bound to be obsoleted, or even completely displaced, by computers. But a couple of chapters in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/creativity-code-art-and-innovation-in-the-age-of-ai/oclc/1111379643&#038;referer=brief_results">The creativity code</a> by Marcus Du Sautoy makes me wonder how else humans and computers will work together.</p><br>
<p>Chess players have been teaming up with computers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151201-the-cyborg-chess-players-that-cant-be-beaten">for a while</a>. But the stories Du Sautoy tells of AlphaGo are something else. AlphaGo <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">was famously</a> the first computer program to beat a professional at the board game <a href="http://www.kiseido.com/three.htm">Go</a>.</p><br>
<p>Go is thousands of years old and was thought too complex for computers to master. But not only did AlphaGo win, many of its moves shocked its opponent, commentators and spectators. Some were downright bizarre, mocked, and even described as &#8220;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609736/alpha-zeros-alien-chess-shows-the-power-and-the-peculiarity-of-ai/">alien</a>&#8220;.</p><br>
<p>AlphaGo had taught itself to play Go. And, as its moves were analysed, it has also taught the rest of us:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>AlphaGo had taught the world a new way to play an ancient game. <strong>Analysis since the match has resulted in new tactics</strong>. The fifth line is now played early on, as we have come to understand that it can have big implications for the endgame. AlphaGo has gone on to discover still more innovative strategies. DeepMind revealed at the beginning of 2017 that its latest iteration had played online anonymously against a range of top-ranking professionals&#8230;<strong>Those games are now regarded as a treasure trove of new ideas</strong>.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like the &#8220;alien&#8221; description. Because while AlphaGo learned from databases of tens of thousands of Go games. It also played millions of games against itself. Where, through trial and error, it came up with iterations we hadn&#8217;t seen before.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>The trouble with modern Go is that conventions had built up about ways to play&#8230; But by breaking those conventions AlphaGo had cleared the fog and revealed an even higher peak&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the humans had also been trained on a store of games past. By playing against itself, AlphaGo broke out of those ruts. And a version of the algorithm that wasn&#8217;t trained on past games at all became even more bizarre and unbeatable.</p><br>
<p>Just think of the possibilities when taken out of the narrow problem of games.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>DeepMind now has an even better algorithm that can thrash the original version of AlphaGo. This algorithm circumvented the need to be shown how humans play the game&#8230; It was no longer constrained by the way humans think and play. Within three days of training, in which time it played 4.9 million games against itself, it was able to beat by 100 games to nil the version of AlphaGo that had defeated Lee Sedol. <strong>What took humans 3000 years to achieve, it did in three days</strong>. By day forty it was unbeatable.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/no-solution-is-perfect/" class="post-header">No solution is perfect</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m re-reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/radical-markets-uprooting-capitalism-and-democracy-for-a-just-society/oclc/1089492374&#038;referer=brief_results">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl for a project I&#8217;m working on. And I have been struck by this in a new foreward by Vitalik Buterin and Jaron Lanier:</p><br><br>
<blockquote><p>It is important to understand the proposed radical markets in the spirit in which they are offered. <strong>A mechanism cannot become the center of human civilization but must serve as a tool in the context of civilization</strong>. That point should be implicit, since many methods are proposed here; obviously, the intent is not to make any one of them singularly dominant.</p><br><br>
</blockquote>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the Radical Markets hype a year ago, it&#8217;s essentially an argument to inject market mechanisms, and our greater knowledge of how markets work, into more aspects of society. Such as by introducing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">quadratic voting</a> in elections to better measure intensity in preferences.</p><br><br>
<p>Or, more spectacularly, perpetually auctioning the use rights of private property. Essentially, allowing anyone to go and bid on any property at any time. The idea being (among other things) to better capture the value of these assets in the tax system.</p><br><br>
<p>There are problems with some of these ideas. Initially at least. Such as that without initial capital reallocation, the removal of certain property rights could lead to more inequality. Or that many people desperately need the stability afforded them by property ownership.</p><br><br>
<p>But I really like this argument that we need to consider the idea within context rather than turning it into a straw man. We need to think of them as mechanisms that could be strategically employed, within an established political economy.</p><br><br>
<p>Especially as our discourse has sped up, as more diverse voices added, it is tempting to summarily dismiss new ideas because they aren&#8217;t perfect. Because there are negative consequences that hadn&#8217;t been considered.</p><br><br>
<p>I like Ryan Avent&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanavent_93844/a-brief-ish-review-of-radical-markets-6454ba0637a8">reading of Radical Markets</a> as a work of political philosophy. On the need to consider radical solutions to big problems. As an appeal to consider market mechanisms in areas that we currently don&#8217;t.</p><br><br>
<p>Again from Buterin and Jaron Lanier:</p><br><br>
<blockquote><p>Abstractions can play out differently according to context. <strong>Any mechanism can be turned into an instrument of violence if it is overly amplified and drowns out every other process in a society</strong>. And yet without better mechanisms, we are doomed to stumble around, failing to address the complexities of our times.</p><br><br>
</blockquote>
<p>None of the rules in society are natural. They&#8217;ve all been contrived. The questions are why and by whom. Injecting markets into more areas of society may make sense. Or maybe the inverse.</p><br><br>
<p>New ideas may not suit as panaceas, but do right in specific situations or after some adaptation. Perhaps it&#8217;s time for something more targeted.</p><br><br>

<h1><a href="/words/the-misadventures-of-cause/" class="post-header">The misadventures of ‘cause’</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the laziest conventions in journalism is the daily stock market report. Something went up or down. And, even though it only just happened, the reporter confidently tells us exactly why.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;ve always found this painful. Teasing out causation from the mass of noise is improbable. Especially with such certainty. Even given sufficient training, tools and time.</p><br>
<p>But as this passage in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quaint-revolution/oclc/1126569133&#038;referer=brief_results">The Man Who Solved the Market</a> highlights, it also likely breeds complacence among the retail investors in the audience.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>During his time helping to run the Medallion fund, Elwyn Berlekamp came to view the narratives that most investors latch on to to explain price moves as quaint, even dangerous, because they <strong>breed misplaced confidence that an investment can be adequately understood and its futures divined</strong>. If it was up to Berlekamp, stocks would have numbers attached to them, not names.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Being so certain and deterministic tricks us into believing the market is <em>knowable</em>. After all, these journalists have brought the word from on high. They have revealed the market&#8217;s Rube Goldberg nature. Can I not learn these secrets too?</p><br>
<p>But, similar to how we miss the tiny influences <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/everything-is-complicated/">when we reason from personal experience</a>, these sweeping narratives of the market are dominated by a few big themes. They turn chaos into a simple story with characters and events, good and bad. They dismiss all the randomness, which is precisely where <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/facts-are-cold/">consistently successful traders like Renaissance</a> stake their claim.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Another lesson of the Renaissance experience is that <strong>there are more factors and variables influencing financial markets and individual investments than most realize or can deduce.</strong> Investors tend to focus on the most basic forces, but there are dozens of factors, perhaps whole dimensions of them, that are missed. Renaissance is aware of <strong>more</strong> of the forces that matter, along with the overlooked mathematical relationships that affect stock prices and other investments, than most anyone else.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>That &#8220;more&#8221; in the last sentence is probably the key. It&#8217;s not that they understand the market. But they&#8217;re looking at more of it. Well past the simplistic correlations that can be delivered in thirty seconds.</p><br>
