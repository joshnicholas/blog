<h1><a href="/words/where-is-the-power-in-a-suit/" class="post-header">Where is the power in a suit?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It‚Äôs hard to separate suits from a profound sense of obligation.</p><br>
<p>I‚Äôve always lived in places for which they are thoroughly, climatically, ill-suited. Yet they are still donned on the regular. As a signal that something is being taken seriously. Or that wearers take themselves seriously.</p><br>
<p>There‚Äôs a separation there, which has historical roots. But makes less and less sense with mass production and the shift of power away from the West.</p><br>
<p>The expectation-filling that guides (forces?) people to wear suits to work, weddings , court and interviews also seems thoroughly at odds with the notion of it as a symbol of power.</p><br>
<p>I‚Äôve never seen this articulated as powerfully as in this <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/9/30/20869237/suits-control-menswear-decline">Vox piece</a> on the decline of suits:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Although the suit is historically associated with projecting elegance, authority, and mastery of a profession, those qualities hearken back to the days when suits were prevalent, worn by the Atticus Finches and Don Drapers of the world. How long until we realize the suit ‚Äî while still used for special occasions and by a shrinking number of traditionalists ‚Äî has become associated with the opposite? The suit has become a uniform for the powerless‚Ä¶.</p><br>
<p>‚Ä¶.When you‚Äôre in control, at least in relative control, from the C-suite down to the long rectangular table in the open-air office, you wear whatever you want, which is almost never a suit. It is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/14/17792298/silicon-valley-stylist-fashion-tech">vest or bomber jacket for men</a> , a blouse or a shell top for women&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a class element here &#8211; which the piece goes into. After all, the decline of the suit as de facto <em>serious person</em> attire is largely taking place in a handful of industries, countries and social strata.</p><br>
<p>And, just as with school uniforms, there may be something to say for suits as something of a leveller. As a well-beaten path into &#8220;<em>respectability</em>&#8220;.</p><br>
<p>However, as suits become less normalised, and more explicitly worn for unpleasant occasions like court, will the association become more sour? Will the power of suits leech even more?</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/diversity-and-the-nuclear-bomb/" class="post-header">Diversity and the nuclear bomb</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It‚Äôs amazing where you find stories about the power of range and diversity in creativity and problem solving. This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/pandoras-keepers-nine-men-and-the-atomic-bomb/oclc/61315497&#038;referer=brief_results">Pandora‚Äôs Keepers</a>, which is proving to be a riveting account of the creation of the first atomic bomb.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúOppenheimer accepted the heavy security as a wartime necessity, but he adamantly refused to accept secrecy in one area: scientific discussion. Here, the normal security procedure of compartmentalization‚Äîlimiting discussion to a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis‚Äîwas not followed, despite protests from Army Intelligence. Oppenheimer held weekly symposia on the pressing technical problems of the moment, <strong>inviting solutions not only from the groups working on the problems but from the important cross-fertilization of agile minds from other disciplines with novel approaches and solutions</strong>. Just as in fission itself, one small suggestion could set off a chain reaction of ideas at a rapid rate. <strong>This fostered a cooperative spirit that maintained high morale</strong>. It was also a major reason why the bomb was built in such a short time.‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Oppenheimer appears to have underestimated the breadth of the task, originally envisioning Los Alamos as a physics lab on steroids. But it eventually grew into a site housing thousands of civilians from many different fields. Specialisation be damned.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/knowledge-is-a-double-edged-sword/" class="post-header">‚ÄòKnowledge is a double edged sword‚Äô</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I‚Äôve been reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/range-why-generalists-triumph-in-a-specialized-world/oclc/1050962413">Range</a> by David Epstein and damn do I have a lot of notes.</p><br>
<p>Hopefully fuel for some future blog posts. But, for now, I haven‚Äôt been able to get over this section in a chapter on non-experts solving problems that bedevilled experts.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúShubin Dai, who lives in Changsha, China, was the top-ranked Kaggle solver in the world as of this writing, out of more than forty thousand contributors. His day job is leading a team that processes data for banks, but Kaggle competitions gave him an opportunity to dabble in machine learning. His favorite problems involve human health or nature conservation, like a competition in which he won $30,000 by wielding satellite imagery to distinguish human-caused from natural forest loss in the Amazon. Dai was asked, for a Kaggle blog post, how important domain expertise is for winning competitions. ‚ÄúTo be frank, I don‚Äôt think we can benefit from domain expertise too much&#8230; <strong>It‚Äôs very hard to win a competition just by using [well-known] methods</strong>,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWe need more creative solutions.‚Äù‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is referring to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>, a site I haven‚Äôt yet found the bravery to crack with my new coding skills üòÖ</p><br>
<p>Anyway, it comes amid an exploration of problem solving, and how experts can be trapped by their domain knowledge, falling back into familiar patterns that haven‚Äôt worked. Meanwhile the answer, as in the case of some of these kaggle competitions, ie often from somewhere else completely.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú‚ÄúThe people who win a Kaggle health competition have no medical training, no biology training, and they‚Äôre also often not real machine learning experts,‚Äù Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher, told me. <strong>‚ÄúKnowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things, but it also makes you blind to other things that you could do.‚Äù‚Äù</strong></p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/the-importance-of-play/" class="post-header">The importance of play</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I‚Äôve just started reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mind-at-play-how-claude-shannon-invented-the-information-age/oclc/1006810545&#038;referer=brief_results">a mind at play</a>, a biography of Claude Shannon. He‚Äôs the ‚Äúfather of information theory‚Äù, without which much of the modern world wouldn‚Äôt be.</p><br>
<p>Shannon reminds me of stories about Richard Feynman. Bursting with curiosity, yes, but also sparked with joy at tinkering with knowledge.</p><br>
<p>I sometimes feel like this is lost in a world where education is sold as preparation for employment rather than rounding someone out or living a fulfilled life.</p><br>
<p>On Shannon:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúHis was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play; he was that rare scientific genius who was <strong>just as content rigging up a juggling robot or a flamethrowing trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits</strong>. He worked with levity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the two. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself. And the marks of his playful mind‚Äîthe mind that wondered how a box of electric switches could mimic a brain, and the mind that asked why no one ever decides to say ‚ÄúXFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ‚Äù‚Äîare imprinted on all of his deepest insights‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>And here‚Äôs a little vignette from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character/oclc/1022267511&#038;referer=brief_results">Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr Feynman</a>, one of my favourite books:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>‚Äú&#8230;I laid out a lot of glass microscope slides, and got the ants to walk on them, back and forth, to some sugar I put on the windowsill. Then, by replacing an old slide with a new one, or by rearranging the slides, I could demonstrate that the ants had no sense of geometry: they couldn‚Äôt figure out where something was. If they went to the sugar one way, and there was a shorter way back, they would never figure out the short way. It was also pretty clear from rearranging the glass slides that the ants left some sort of trail&#8230;‚Äù</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is this Feynman as a child luxuriating in experimentation and learning for its own sake, but also him repeating the story years later. Despite a dismal career as an myrmecologist, that‚Äôs how important and formative he thought experiences like this were.</p><br>
<p>Putting aside personal fulfilment, I wonder how successful Feynman and Shannon would have been had they not ‚Äúwasted‚Äù time building up other adjacent stores of knowledge.</p><br>
<p>Especially considering how successful they were at bringing new perspectives and slants to established ideas.</p><br>
