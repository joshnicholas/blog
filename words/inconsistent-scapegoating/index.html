<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>The people who have always been able to do something about this — the ones building the software — have always known when their software was doing something wrong. It&#8217;s their <em>job</em> to find bugs, and if they&#8217;re worth their salt, they&#8217;re always looking for flaws in the overall design, as well as the functional components of what they&#8217;re building. They know that violating user privacy without consent is a bug. <strong>Operating in a way inconsistent with the user&#8217;s expectations is a bug. Coercing people into using your product with psychological tricks is a bug.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Though many of these poor designs are instigated by higher-ups, they are ultimately implemented by professionals with a deep knowledge of their field. <strong>Designers know when they&#8217;re mocking up screens that prey on people&#8217;s most basic desires; developers know when they&#8217;re implementing designs that would feel incredibly wrong as the end user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from an <a href="https://write.as/matt/how-to-actually-fix-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old article by Matt Baer</a>, and is talking about problematic business models in general on the internet.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t about Facebook or any specific scandal.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s an interesting thought. It isn&#8217;t just Zuckerberg or Kalanick or [pick your leader of scandal generating tech company].</p>
<p>The people that write the code and design the interfaces know what they&#8217;re doing. Perhaps we should hold them as morally responsible as we do financiers?</p>
<p>(As always my emphasis)</p>
