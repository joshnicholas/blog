<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/where-does-your-belief-come-from/">struggling</a> with the notion of beliefs as the output of a transitory and “swirling mass” of complexity inside each of us. Myriad tiny influences we can neither observe nor prise apart.</p><br>
<p>But, assuming this theory is valid, the logical conclusion is that the quality of the information you allow in is incredibly important. If that which inspires your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">System 1</a> thinking is rubbish, so is your thinking.</p><br>
<p>From <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Asked to account for our beliefs and choices, how often would we say it was an unknown nudge from the flotsam of incidentals? <strong>‘I probably only believe this because I pulled the equivalent of a red sock from my mental laundry under the influence of the last thing I heard in a bar. . .’</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>If the incidentals are so important, unpredictable and seemingly invisible, it’s not enough to swamp the bad with good. The only answer is to be incredibly vigilant about what gets in.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps this will prove easier than <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/">culling</a> the poorly informed and conscious conspirators from our social networks.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/where-does-your-belief-come-from/" class="post-header">Where does your belief come from?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve posted a lot of stuff on this blog questioning the foundations of belief.</p><br>
<p>How our beliefs are the <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/">function of the people we surround ourself with</a> or are <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/time-to-update-our-democratic-models/">built during our formative years and then ossify</a>. How language and culture both <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-the-west/">inform and limit what we can take in</a>. And that much appears to be <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-are-we-not-keeping-up/">stuck in formative states</a>.</p><br>
<p>But twice this week I’ve come across arguments that our “beliefs” are actually so transitory and shallow that they are all but meaningless.</p><br>
<p>That we are so riven with contradictions and so lacking a coherent world view that our “beliefs” are little more than fleeting notions backed up by post hoc rationing.</p><br>
<p>First in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds">an old New Yorker article</a> that makes me <a href="https://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/04/10/fact-checking-is.html">seriously question</a> ever again trying to change someone’s mind.</p><br>
<p>And now in my <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/singles-not-home-runs/">continued</a> reading of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&amp;referer=brief_results">The Hidden Half</a>:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We asked our volunteers to choose their political priorities on a scale of 1 to 10. For example, what would you do if it came to a choice whether the country should spend more on state-provided healthcare, or spend less and cut taxes (where 1 was definitely spend more and 10 was definitely cut tax)?&#8230;A short while later, we went back to talk over with our volunteers what they’d written and why. But <strong>we cheated</strong>. We left their original answer sheet as it was–written in their own hand with their names at the top to help convince them nothing fishy was going on. But where their answers were anywhere from 3 to 7–so not a definite 1 or a definite, uncompromising 10–<strong>we flipped the question around</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>These are quite long quotes, but bear with me.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>The partially handwritten page in front of them was evidence of what they believed–or so they thought. And <strong>it was this (doctored) opinion that they now defended</strong>. I sat down with a man who originally said that tax cuts were more important than more spending on state healthcare–and listened as he now explained why the opposite was true. His explanation was earnest, intelligent, clear, without hesitation. He wasn’t confused. <strong>He accepted this new position as a legitimate summary of his beliefs and didn’t miss a beat in justifying them</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>I’ve read of studies where people surrender their opinion in the face of a majority or authority figure.</p><br>
<p>But that we are so intellectually supplicant that an unrecorded belief is essentially meaningless has quite thrown me. And that we could be dictated to by a recorded belief &#8211; even a false one &#8211; even more so.</p><br>
<p>To a certain extent this merely lines up with previous arguments in the book about complexity and simplification. But the lack of stability in the “lens” we use to understand the world &#8211; that I can’t feed you similar information over and over and expect a somewhat predictable response &#8211; has huge implications for discourse and institutions.</p><br>
<p>Let me end with a concluding remark from this section of the book:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the ideal of holding a complete picture in our heads damns our capabilities with an impossible aspiration. The world, quite simply, is too complicated, too big, too messy, to frame in one go. The fact that we observe it in often contradictory fragments is also a measure of the enormity of the perceptual ask.</p><br></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/climate-change-is-already-here-its-just-unevenly-distributed/" class="post-header">Climate change is already here, it’s just unevenly distributed</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The title is from a <a href="https://twitter.com/kmac/status/1115403407433457665?s=20">tweet</a> by Kate Mackenzie, although I’m unsure if she was referencing someone else.</p><br>
<p>It highlights a central problem in tackling climate change.</p><br>
<p>By now most educated people around the world are at least aware of anthropogenic climate change. Even if they refuse to accept it.</p><br>
<p>So the problem is not really one of education, but salience. Even if most are aware of, and intellectually accept, the phenomena, it’s just not present in their day to day lives.</p><br>
<p>Climate change is already devastating farmers with increased variability and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/04/climate-change-rising-sea-levels-west-africa-coastal-cities/586651/?utm_source=feed">hammering certain exposed communities</a>. But for most it only really exists in the periodic news report. It’s like a far away war or natural disaster &#8211; easy to miss in an increasingly comfortable and abstracted day to day.</p><br>
<p>Given both the looming catastrophe and what we know of the health impact of pollution, it’s insufficient to simply “inform people” and sit back &#8211; the most comfortable mode for the news media.</p><br>
<p>Accurate reporting and discussion of climate change is more than highlighting the results. We have to engage with the process. The currently invisible must be made unmissable.</p><br>
<p>The question is &#8211; how do you turn something that takes place subtly and slowly, often only visible in the varied probability and intensity of “normal” events, into something that can’t be missed? That affects their day to day?</p><br>
<p>How do you increase salience?</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/singles-not-home-runs/" class="post-header">Singles not home runs</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Watching professional sports, you often see a team that is behind suddenly go into desperation mode. The clock is ticking, so a flailing three pointer is launched from ten feet behind the line. Or the batter suddenly tries to hit the skin off of every pitch.</p><br>
<p>In reality it&#8217;s often not so dire. And trying to catch up in one go will likely doom you to failure. Hence the refrain &#8211; heard in many sports, not just baseball &#8211; that the way to go is by hitting singles, not home runs.</p><br>
<p>Just get onto first base. The person behind you will try and get you to second, etc. Go for a two pointer and not a three.</p><br>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to win it in one go. You won&#8217;t be the big hero. But you&#8217;ve got a better chance of succeeding.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the weight given to big leaps, and in turn the relegation of  smaller, safer gains, as I <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continue</a> to read <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Half</a>.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We need to face the possibility that big influences are not as orderly or consistent as we expect, that <strong>the way things turn out is bound less by observable laws, forces or common factors than by the mass of uncommon factors, the jumble of hidden, micro-influences</strong>. Our habit of thinking of this as ‘noise’–and then thinking of ‘noise’ in turn as an annoying residual–diminishes one of life’s most magical elements.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of course, just as on the playing field, the heroes of academia and intellect are the ones who make the big play, not the tinkerers and exception finders.</p><br>
<p>But so often these big leaps wind up in incongruencies or pale in significance to the influence of smaller ones.</p><br>
<p>It&#8217;s not as sexy, but perhaps we should be emphasising something else &#8211; singles, not home runs.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>We dream of laws and general truths; the practicality is often a patchwork of unexpected anomalies. Run with these ideas, apply them more widely, and you begin to conceive a world bustling with powerful but enigmatic differences that we just don’t see.</p><br>
</blockquote>
