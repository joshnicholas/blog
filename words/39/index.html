<h1><a href="/words/isaac-newton/" class="post-header">Isaac Newton</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Like a lot of people, I was absolutely entranced by this year’s remake of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos. It wasn&#8217;t just the stunning visuals and mind-blowing science, it was the stories of the people who have carried us this far. The giants upon whose shoulders we now stand. Michael Faraday, William Herschel, Joseph von Fraunhofer, Cecilia Payne, Edmond Halley, and, of course, Isaac Newton (to name a few). Cosmos made them all come alive, and gave me a thirst to know more about them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the series will be continued. So, for anyone like me, its time to hit the books. Let’s begin with the man who laid the foundation of the modern world &#8211; Isaac Newton.</span></p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">&#8220;He was born into a world of darkness, obscurity, and magic; led a strangely pure and obsessive life, lacking parents, lovers, and friends; quarrelled bitterly with great men who crossed his path; veered at least once to the brink of madness; cloaked his work in secrecy; and yet discovered more of the essential core of human knowledge than anyone before or after.&#8221;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Isaac Newton is a peculiar figure. Anyone who has received any semblance of a liberal education can probably name him and some of his achievements. You may even be able to recall his pointed nose and luscious hair. But what do we know beyond that? Where was he born? How did he work? What drove him? This is where James Gleick steps in. Many of you may know of Gleick. He’s a prominent science writer, with several other great books out there (a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400096235/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400096235&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=WJ6W55WGRAF7MDIH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Information</a> is forthcoming). But the deftness with which he brings science to the less erudite is really on show with this biography. It’s not a long book, more of a Newton summary really, but it hits the high points. It begins with a visit to Woolsthorpe &#8211; where Newton was born, works through his education and scientific awakening, and finishes with Newton’s legacy. That last subject being something that could fill whole libraries.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">&#8220;What Newton learned remains the essence of what we know, as if by our own intuition&#8221;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a small book — my edition comes in at under two hundred pages — there is an incredible amount to be gleaned about the life of Isaac Newton. How many of us really consider Isaac Newton the ostensible orphan? When school children learn about his theories in science textbooks, do we realise how hard up the young Newton was for simple paper and pens, let alone textbooks? When we imagine him sitting under the Apple tree (surely a myth), do we conjure the ways the young Newton really did turn the natural world into a veritable laboratory? How many of us imagine a man famous for calculating his way through the mysterious of the cosmos, also filling notebooks with the ingredients for paint, the Bible&#8217;s hidden codes, and lists of thousands of nouns in different languages (etc.)? His forays into alchemy and other scorned fields are legendary, but did you know Newton had to be goaded into publishing his legitimate work? Even his famous Principia? Textbooks and popular imagination give us an image of Newton as a robot genius. But Gleick reveals him to be so much more. An irascible yet modest man, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge changed the world.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“It was nature’s destiny now to be mathematised. Henceforth space would have dimension and measure; the moon would be subject to geometry.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Newton’s life is fascinating, and, as all good biographers do, Gleick has revealed his subject to be much more than our cartoonish popular conception. The book is well written, really, I demolished it in a day. But it’s arguable how much this is due to it’s readability as to it’s length. And it’s the length that gets me. Gleick really, manages little more than pulling back the curtain on a giant of the modern age. And when you consider how much context he must provide — on the age of Enlightenment, the wars with Hooke and Leibniz over no less than Gravity and Calculus (etc.) — it’s no wonder we emerge on the other end having barely touched his personality or character. Newton was a revolutionary, his shadow still falls over science, economics, mathematics, philosophy, theology, and much, much more. As a short dip into his life and works, Gleick’s book is more than sufficient. As a study of one of the most influential men in history, it leaves a lot to be desired.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“No one feels the burden of Newton’s legacy, looming forward from the past, more than the modern scientist. A worry nags at his descendants: that Newton may have been too successful; that the power of his methods gave them too much authority.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/adam-smith/" class="post-header">Adam Smith</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Adam Smith is one of those figures that flits in the background of modern life. His work impacts us all, but how many know his name? His profile adorns the textbooks of eager university students, but ask them what he contributed. Even amongst those who know of Smith and his work, who can tell us what inspired and shaped him? What twigged that led him to become the prime mover of modern economics? The stories of comparable men in other fields &#8211; Aristotle and biology, Galileo and astronomy, Humbolt and geography; are common knowledge. Their fame and name so dwarf their contemporaries that they all but stand alone in our imaginations. Adam Smith has no such legend. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8313636-adam-smith?ac=1&#038;from_search=true">story of his quest for a theory of everything</a> deserves to be told.</span></p>
</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">&#8220;The Wealth of Nations is the greatest and most enduring monument to the intellectual culture of the Scottish Enlightenment. It contains a theory about the behaviour of human beings when they are seen through the lens of Scottish politeness, about agents who are deeply committed to the improvement of mind, manners and property, and are able to believe that in following what seems to be the path of nature they are acting in a way that will serve the public good.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, Adam Smith did not leave a paper trail. He lived with his mother for most of his life, wasn’t much of a correspondent and forced his friends to destroy his personal papers. Really, if it weren’t for David Hume, his few loyal students and his published work, we wouldn’t be left with anything at all. As a result, ideas are all that survive of Smith, and the narrative Phillipson has managed to piece together is entirely an intellectual one. The source material for the tale Phillipson tells is the world that surrounded Smith. Through the courses he took at Glasgow and Oxford, and the notes of his own students, we see a man indebted to Classical Philosophy and Rhetoric. From his friendship with Hume and the set with which he roamed, we find a tireless intellect. And out of his lectures and books we see a theorist drawing from all that surrounded him — from the coffers of Scottish merchants, to the work habits of Oxford dons and the writings of French academics — in the quest to develop a theory of everything.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">&#8220;Rousseau once famously remarked that while men were born free, everywhere they were in chains. In Smith&#8217;s view the chains were those of the imagination, chains could be loosened by a common sense, sceptical awareness of the processes by which the moral personality was formed, but never altogether thrown off.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although what we end up with is a jagged silhouette in the middle of a busy canvas — as Phillipson is able to paint around the subject but little more, perhaps the reader is not the worse for wear. The key points of any good biography are more than met. We are introduced to the world in which Smith lived; where Western Philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment were in full bloom. We encounter both that which inspired Smith, and the full cohort that he in turn inspired. We meet his contemporaries, and accompany him on the better-documented journeys in his later life. All without the emotional baggage of your average biography. I am almost of a mind to thank Smith for removing his personal details from the occasion, it’s much cleaner this way. If you are someone who really wants to learn and benefit from Smith’s intellectual journey, and can stand a rigorous biography, this book is definitely recommended. Maybe if more read this book Smith wouldn’t be flitting in the background.</span></p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>p class=&#8221;p3&#8243; style=&#8221;text-align: center;&#8221;><em><span class="s1">&#8220;For in the last resort, the Wealth of Nations, like the Theory of Moral Sentiments and the lectures on which it drew, was a call to his contemporaries to take moral, political and intellectual control of their lives and the lives of those for whom they were responsible. It is in such contexts that the Wealth of Nations needs to be read by historians. The rest can be left to his disciples and critics.&#8221;</span></em></p>

<h1><a href="/words/why-nations-fail/" class="post-header">Why Nations Fail</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As we delve further into the twenty-first century, the BRIC and MINT countries are converging with those that have sat atop the heap for so long. They are leaving many nations and billions of people behind. But why is this so? Why did the industrial revolution kick off in England and take only select countries with it? Why were Japan and South Korea able to leave their region in the dust during the twentieth century, and how has Nigeria recently stormed past it’s neighbours? Why is China now set to become king of the mountain, not so long after Mao dragged it to such drastic lows? Why are some countries poor while others prosperous, some successful while others not, and why do these fortunes ebb and flow? In short, what is the magic ingredient? There are many books out there with a claim to answer. Their theories range from the geographic to the cultural. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have yet another to add to the pile; for them, the secret sauce is creative destruction. And the differences between success or failure is the presence or absence of institutions that foster it.</span></p>
</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“Countries differ in their economic success because of their different institutions, the rules influencing how the economy works, and the incentives that motivate people.”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Creative Destruction is an idea popularised by the economist Joseph Schumpeter to refer to a process of incessant industrial revolution, of innovations pushing out the antiquated. It is records making way for cassettes, CD’s bowing before Mp3 players. Why Nations Fail is built on the premise that this innovation, this creative destruction, is a necessary ingredient in the success of a country. And further, for a nation to harness creative destruction requires a certain amount of freedom, transparency and protection for it&#8217;s citizens. According to Acemoglu and Robinson, these are features of society that are granted or restricted by it’s institutions. So-called “inclusive institutions” are markets, laws and norms that protect and incentivise innovation and productivity. They foster creative destruction and are the building blocks of a successful society. On the other hand, “extractive institutions” are ones that protect and enrich the elite, that dis-incentivise productivity and innovation. They hinder creative destruction and are a recipe for a failed nation. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“The fear of creative destruction is the main reason why there was no sustained increase in living standards between the Neolithic and Industrial revolutions. Technological innovation makes human societies prosperous, but also involves the replacement of the old with the new, and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of certain people.”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Viewing the world through this prism gives Acemoglu and Robinson an explanation for where we are, and where we are going. The countries that today enjoy a high standard of living are those that have established multi-party democracies, transparency and protection through the rule of law and independent judiciaries, and incentives through free markets and patents (etc). On the other hand, countries that have seen dictatorships and despots, entrenched elites, disruptive monopolies and subsidies, and few political rights; have failed, are in the process of failing, or will soon do so. Acemoglu and Robinson explain that the Industrial Revolution kicked off in Britain because the citizens had already achieved hard won restrictions on the elite. Power was distributed and new protections in areas such as patents rewarded innovation and productivity. Pioneers like James Watt &#8211; famous for his steam engine — were not shut out by a rent-seeking aristocracy. Further, the efforts of these pioneers to secure their gains ensured a virtuous cycle, a promulgation of new institutions to further codify gains. According to Acemoglu and Robison, Britain hosted the Industrial Revolution because it’s inclusive institutions had already made way for the mother of creative destruction, and creative destruction begat even more creative destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the United States is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite.” </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The authors use compelling examples and “experiments” to back up their claims — most notably, the difference between Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora; a city that straddles the border between the United States and Mexico. This one city provides a seemingly perfect “natural experiment” of the institution thesis; as geography, culture, and ethnicity are the same on both sides of the fence. Arguably, it is only recent history, which has resulted in differing institutions, that have caused the diverging living standards for the two Nogales. But there is more. Other examples trotted up by the authors include East and West Germany, Spanish South America &#8211; where the indigenous population were exploited to cash in on an abundance of natural resources, and English North America &#8211; where a scant aboriginal population and minimal natural resources forced the English to transplant and incentivise a European population. West Germany is still footing the bill for the shambles that was East Germany. The inhabitants of Spanish South America were turned into chattel, while the new inhabitants of North America progressed and built institutions to protect their growing status. More examples come in the analysis of East and Western Europe &#8211; where Western Europe had largely managed to reign in their monarchs and elites, much of Eastern Europe carried the burdens of Serfdom and Feudalism well into the twentieth century. While industry promulgated in the West, Eastern Lords bound their subjects and continued personally profitable agrarian economies. Most compelling for me was an exploration of Australia &#8211; where a scarcity of labour similar to North America forced the English to incentivise immigrants. The Convicts and settlers went on to build institutions to secure what they had gains in a similar fashion to their brothers elsewhere, institutions that are the foundations of modern Australia. Through numerous examples, Acemoglu and Robinson show that the countries that have succeeded have done so by following an economic ideal of productivity and innovation over monopoly and rent seeking, and they have done so not out of economic rationality, but political necessity.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“World inequality today exists because during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some nations were able to take advantage of the industrial revolution and the technologies and methods of organization that it brought while others were unable to do so”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why Nations Fail is a book that kicked up a storm of debate in the academic and development communities. The reviews written by the authors of other theories are enlightening, as are the responses of Acemoglu and Robinson. However, there are also major flaws in this work. One look at the book jacket, at those who have lent their names to promote it, raises questions. They are a remarkably homogenous bunch. People like Niall Ferguson &#8211; who even utilises some similar examples in his book, Civilisation. And, I’ll be honest, I tore through this book, loving it the entire way. It’s message appealed to me. But of course people like Niall Ferguson and myself love it. It offers a theory that takes a very Eurocentric view of the world, and then works backwards. Democracy and much of the social and political norms cherished in the West are taken as given and as ideal, and then ascribed major roles in past success. Niall Ferguson, myself, and everyone else on that jacket have a natural predilection to this theory. Our innate biases are towards the institutions that have allowed us to prosper and thrive in our wonderful, Western societies. But can liberalism really be the only path to success? The cloud overhanging all of this is the lack of real explanation of what’s going on in places like China &#8211; a nation ravaged by extractive institutions if there ever was one, yet with an economy growing pell mell and a massive savings rate. If anything, success is simply too complicated for such a grand unified theory. However, and whether you agree with their theory or not, Acemoglu and Robinson have produced a fantastic book. A great read. This is one of those library books that I really wish I had bought. From the moment I started reading it, I have wanted to share it with all and sundry. I have my doubts, but I highly recommend it. At the very least it will provoke debate and introspection.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em><span class="s1">“Nations fail today because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate.”</span></em></p>

<h1><a href="/words/informing-the-news/" class="post-header">Informing The News</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Who doesn’t lament the state of the news media? Their preoccupation with celebrities, disasters, scandals, crime, the political horserace, and other such pabulum and infotainment. But Thomas E. Patterson also deplores the state of democracy, and views the two as inextricably linked. Just as ninety years ago Walter Lippmann warned the “crisis in Western Democracy is a crisis in journalism,” Patterson has sought to highlight the deficiencies in modern journalism, how it is affecting our ability to self-govern, and has offered an antidote; knowledge-based journalism.</span></p>
</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;It is a short step from misinformation to mischief, as we have seen repeatedly in recent policy.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around the world, studies measuring trust and satisfaction consistently put journalists at the bottom of professions. Even below politicians. All the while, the traditional mass media lose audience to the purveyors of satire, punditry and hackery. The financial issues facing the journalism industry are well documented, but as Patterson points out throughout the book, there is a deeper crisis facing the profession. Journalism has become dumbed down. Even name-brand journalism schools have structured their courses to more resemble trade schools than instructors of a vital component in a functioning democracy. Journalists increasingly have little experience or knowledge in the subjects that they cover. While technical expertise may be exemplary, content expertise is often lacking.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;It is nearly impossible to have sensible public deliberation when large numbers of people are out of touch with reality.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an age of tight deadlines and slimmed down newsrooms, this is a disaster for creating an informed public. Serious policy is overlooked while much simpler — for the journalist as well as the consumer — political hackery is played up. Minor but easy to understand developments — such as interest and inflation blips — are held under the microscope, while the larger picture — the state of the business cycle for example — is all but lost. Powerful figures — such as those who pushed for the invasion of Iraq &#8211; are left unchecked by those ill equipped to do so. All the while, journalists must rely ever more on outsiders to do fundamental aspects of their jobs — providing context and scrutiny in a world bursting with information. Studies show that the public are consistently misinformed on a variety of important subjects, and, as Patterson points out, many of these subjects bear a startling correlation to the innate biases of a profession that is chasing its audience and has lost sight of its intellectual rigour. Is there any doubt of the cumulative effect?</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;Informed citizens do not spring forth from birth. The process of informing the public is an ongoing task”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Patterson, the answer to both conundrums is the injection of “knowledge” back into journalism. Specifically, the “knowledge of how to use knowledge”. Obviously, the variety of subjects that any one journalist will encounter during a career is too much to become intimate with all of it. But similar can be said of a teacher. So, like teachers, Patterson suggests that journalists be trained in the fundamentals of what they need — history, analytical thinking, ethics, data analysis , etc. But also like teachers, they should be trained in communicating across these subjects. Providing context and other information in order that the audience can “make sense of the events”. According to Patterson, this “content knowledge” would take journalism a step closer to fulfilling its duty to democracy, all the while distancing it from the innumerable hacks who operate on the internet for free. Knowledge, Patterson claims, is the solution to more than one of the problems that plagues journalism.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;Knowledge is the starting point as well as the end product of systematic inquiry, guiding the practitioner in what to look for as well as what to make of what is found.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a citizen, an avid news consumer, and someone who spends considerable time in a newsroom every week, Pattersons&#8217; book rings horribly true on many levels. The lack of socially beneficial news and a common set of facts, as well as the incursion of infotainment into the “bible of democracy” has undoubtedly harmed the public square. I would be glad to see more informed voices take the stage. But I am sceptical that there is a place for such a development. Recent election coverage in Australia and America was abysmal, topped only by the bush-league reporting of the actual governance after the spectacle. But it is this, along with the blow-by-blow accounts of everything royal and celebrity, beat-ups and other fluff; that really pulls in the ratings. Look at what actually gets shared on social media. Its cat pictures and Upworthy, not the Washington Post or the Financial Times. Patternsons’ book gives a great account of much of what ails the news media. I’m not so sure how much demand there is for his cure.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>“Journalists are in the daily business of making the unseen visible, of connecting us to the world beyond our direct experience.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></p>
