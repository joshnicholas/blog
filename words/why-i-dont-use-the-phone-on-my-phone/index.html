<h1 class="post-header">Why I dont use the phone on my phone</h1>


<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>
<p>“Not picking up the phone would be like someone knocking at your door and you standing behind it not answering. <strong>It was, at the very least, rude, and quite possibly sneaky or creepy or something</strong>. Besides, as the phone rang, there were always so many questions, so many things to sort out. Who was it? What did they want? Was it for … me?”</p>
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/561545">an interesting piece</a> by Alexis C. Madrigal on the demise of phone calls. But I don&#8217;t think he does enough to drive home the shift that has taken place.</p><br>
<p>Phone calls are an especially violent form of communication. This is in part because they are strictly synchronous &#8211; all participants have to take part at the same time &#8211; but also because a ringing telephone is incredibly distracting.</p><br>
<p>Unless it has been scheduled beforehand, a phone call by definition places the caller&#8217;s needs above the recipient. Without the screening technology of newer forms of communication, anyone with your number can impose their consciousness onto yours.</p><br>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t answer. No matter what you are doing.</p><br>
<p>But the plethora of asynchronous communications methods &#8211; text messages, email, social media etc. &#8211; means the bar to phone calls is now higher. Or at least it should be.</p><br>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t life or death, or you don&#8217;t need an answer five minutes ago, then don&#8217;t call me. There are plenty of ways to communicate that don&#8217;t prioritise one person above another.</p><br>
<p>Calling when it isn&#8217;t necessary is, in fact, quite rude.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;No one picks up the phone anymore. Even many businesses do everything they can to avoid picking up the phone&#8230; There are many reasons for the slow erosion of this commons. The most important aspect is structural: There are simply more communication options.&#8221;
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, society hasn&#8217;t quite caught up to this new norm. Or, at least, older generations haven&#8217;t.</p><br>
