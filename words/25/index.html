<h1><a href="/words/more-proof-trump-isnt-interested-in-learning-anything/" class="post-header">More proof Trump isnt interested in learning anything</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109421-the-fifth-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fifth Risk</a> by Michael Lewis, and, to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure that he does either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the story of the Trump transition. Or, rather, the lack of one. The book isn&#8217;t particularly long. More like a Vanity Fair column that got out of hand. Some of the vignettes of public service meander, too many are hagiographic, and there are more than necessary.</p>
<p>Lewis also explicitly repeats themes &#8211; that most of the problems with government are practical rather than political, for example.</p>
<p>But Fifth Risk is a brilliant portrait of what happens when the people in charge are thoroughly unconcerned with learning anything new. Either because they think they know better, tribalism stops them recognising anyone else&#8217;s competence, or they just don&#8217;t want to know.</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;A month after the election, Pyle arrived for a meeting with Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Deputy Secretary Sherwood-Randall, and Knobloch&#8230;“He did not seem motivated to spend a lot of time understanding the place,” says Sherwood-Randall. “He didn’t bring a pencil or a piece of paper. He didn’t ask questions. He spent an hour. That was it. He never asked to meet with us again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle eventually sent over a list of seventy-four questions he wanted answers to. His list addressed some of the subjects covered in the briefing materials, but also a few not: Can you provide a list of all Department of Energy employees or contractors who have attended any Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon meetings? Can you provide a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any of the Conference of the Parties (under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in the last five years? That, in a nutshell, was the spirit of the Trump enterprise. “It reminded me of McCarthyism,” says Sherwood-Randall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230;Pyle vanished from the scene. According to a former Obama official, he was replaced by a handful of young ideologues who called themselves “the Beachhead Team.” “They mainly ran around the building insulting people,” says a former Obama official. “There was a mentality that everything that government does is stupid and bad and the people in it are stupid and bad,” says another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again, I&#8217;m not sure we didn&#8217;t already know this about the Trump organisation. So far I&#8217;ve read every book Lewis has written, and I will probably buy the next as well. But this one may be safe to miss.</p>
<p>The writing is pretty good though.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/another-adjacent-possible/" class="post-header">Another adjacent possible</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Working my way through one of the more fascinating technology books I&#8217;ve ever come across, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21948821-code">Code</a> by Charles Petzold. I stumbled across this passage:</p>
<p><!----></p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230;<strong>nobody in the nineteenth century made the connection between the ANDs and ORs of Boolean algebra and the wiring of simple switches in series and in parallel</strong>. No mathematician, no electrician, no telegraph operator, nobody. Not even that icon of the computer revolution Charles Babbage (1792–1871), who had corresponded with Boole and knew his work, and who struggled for much of his life designing first a Difference Engine and then an Analytical Engine that a century later would be regarded as the precursors to modern computers&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from a chapter on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean logic</a> (aka Boolean algebra), which you might have come across if you have ever studied programming, statistics or electrical engineering.</p>
<p>I’ve never before had it explained to me in such a cogent fashion. But what this sections highlights in particular (and the book as a whole rams home) is the power of bringing together seemingly disconnected ideas, theories and fields.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8230;What might have helped Babbage, we know now, was the realization that perhaps instead of gears and levers to perform calculations, a computer might better be built out of telegraph relays&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great book if you want to understand how computers work, as it combines engineering and information theory to construct a virtual computer, step by step. Starting with a simple light bulb circuit, through logic gates, operating systems and graphical interfaces.</p>
<p>But it is arguably more valuable in demonstrating how something as complex as a computer draws from many fields.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/exercising-the-democracy-muscle/" class="post-header">Exercising the democracy muscle</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We have this view of America as a place of rugged individualism, but a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/losing-the-democratic-habit/568336/">piece in The Atlantic</a> argues this is precisely why it faces a democratic crisis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;participation in civic groups and organizations of all kinds declined precipitously in the last decades of the 20th century. The trend has, if anything, accelerated since then; one study found that from 1994 to 2004, membership in such groups fell by 21 percent&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Trump secured the Republican nomination by speaking directly to those voters who had the least experience with democratic institutions&#8230; among those who seldom or never participated in community activities such as sports teams, book clubs, parent-teacher associations, or neighborhood associations, Trump led 50 to 24 percent.<strong> In fact, such civically disengaged voters accounted for a majority of his support</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>For two centuries Americans created, joined and participated in &#8220;democratic institutions&#8221;, ranging from parents associations to sports teams, unions and even freed slaves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting concept, that democracy is not just something you are born a part of, but a skill or temperament that can be developed through practice. It also makes intuitive sense &#8211; teamwork and going through a process doesn&#8217;t come naturally, building connections and friendships can make it all easier. It&#8217;s why incumbent politicians are often more effective than rookies.</p>
<p>It also makes sense that operating at a sub-political level creates space for this kind of development. There aren&#8217;t the cataclysmic debates over things like abortion. It&#8217;s a lot easier to see how a fellow parent at your child&#8217;s school is on your side &#8211; both your children will benefit from higher standards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Voluntary associations have provided the people with their greatest school of self-government, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. wrote in 1944. Rubbing minds as well as elbows, they have been trained from youth to take common counsel, choose leaders, harmonize differences, and obey the expressed will of the majority. <strong>In mastering the associative way they have mastered the democratic way</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Democratic governance is never the most efficient means of running an organization, as anyone who&#8217;s attended a local zoning hearing can attest. Its value lies instead in harmonizing discordant interests and empowering constituents. <strong>A nation of passive observers watching others make decisions is a nation that will succumb to anger and resentment, witness the United States</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how you replace this kind of volunteerism, as it seems to be the victim of several irreversible trends, such as the rise of online communities (supplanting the local one), the explosion in activities to distract yourself with, and human sorting. But it does seem the importance is the practice, rather than education.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;One recent study found that, holding all else equal, greater knowledge of civics among high-school seniors correlated with a 2 percent greater likelihood of voting in a presidential election eight years later. Active participation in extracurricular activities, however, correlated with a 141 percent increase.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/fixing-the-news/" class="post-header">Fixing the news</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>&#8230;the news actually fails to deliver on its single biggest promise: to tell us whats happening in the world&#8230; It portrays the world to us as a never ending string of sensational, unusual, terrible, rapidly forgotten events. In contrast to fake news, which is misleading because its simply untrue, <strong>real news misleads us in a more subtle and fundamental way. It gives us a deeply skewed view of probability, history, progress, development, and relevance</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://medium.com/de-correspondent/the-problem-with-real-news-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-f29aca95c2ea">a piece</a> by Rob Wijnberg, founder of the Dutch media startup <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/">De Correspondent</a>. It is something I desperately wish I had written.</p>
<p>I became a journalist because I love learning and telling stories. I have a peculiar bent on the world and wanted to throw that into the mix. But I&#8217;ve found myself constantly foxed by many of the journalistic conventions that Wijnberg writes about.</p>
<p>The laser focus on the aberrant, the binary rather than probabilistic nature of expression, outsourcing of analysis to the establishment or a small pool of experts, bothsidesism, viewing everything through the lens of politics, and the need to publish discrete rather than iterative content.</p>
<p>These are just some of the many biases in modern journalism. But, unfortunately, none of them seem to be about fostering deeper <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<p>Most of all, I found my life ruled by &#8220;hooks&#8221; &#8211; filtering stories through arbitrary calendar events or something that has just happened. There needs to be a reason to publish this now, it goes, and the lens we have chosen is time. So we forego the issues that should <em>always</em> be published.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;news also <strong>makes us blind to the influential that is not exceptional at all</strong>. Thats why we often don&#8217;t hear about major developments until something highly improbable happens&#8230; The 2008 financial crisis, for example, didn&#8217;t become huge news until the Lehman Brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy  a highly unusual event. But the lead up to this event &#8211;   banks that kept piling risk on top of risk, little by little, day by day   never made it to the front page because of the <strong>fundamental mismatch between what was happening (gradual risk increase) and the way news commonly signals what is happening (event-driven sensationalism)</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if De Correspondent&#8217;s model is the antidote, or part of a suite of necessary reforms (I almost just fell into the binary trap there again), but it&#8217;s certainly one to watch.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the first thing we do is teach our correspondents to seriously moderate their own consumption of news. We encourage them to seek inspiration for article ideas outside of the days newspapers, talk shows, and tweets  by going out into the streets, by reading books, and, above all, by asking our readers the question, What do you encounter every day at work or in your life that rarely makes the front page, but really should?</p></blockquote>
