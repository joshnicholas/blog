<h1><a href="/words/what-happened-to-the-dynamism-of-religions/" class="post-header">What happened to the dynamism of religions?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Buddhist monks follow a lot of rules – 253 in one tradition, 200 in another. As the story goes, all of these rules were made by the Buddha himself. However, he did not announce them all at once, like Moses descending from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. Instead, <strong>they’re said to have evolved organically, with the Buddha making a rule only after he judged a particular deed to be a misdeed</strong>.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>This, from <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-buddhist-monk-who-became-an-apostle-for-sexual-freedom">an interesting article</a> about the celibacy of Buddhist monks. It made me think of similar passages in a book I recently read about the Islamic world, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6240926-destiny-disrupted">Destiny Disrupted</a>.</p><br>
</p><br>
<blockquote><p>During Abu Bakr’s khalifate, at Omar’s suggestion, all the pieces of the Qur’an were compiled in one place. It was a miscellaneous collection at first, because <strong>when the revelations were coming in, people recorded them on anything that came to hand</strong> &#8211; a sheet of parchment, a piece of leather, a stone, a bone, whatever. As khalifa, Omar began a sorting process. In his presence, each written verse was checked against the memorized version kept by the professional reciters whom this society regarded as the most reliable keepers of information. <strong>Scribes then recorded the authorized copy of each verse before witnesses, and these verses were organized into one comprehensive collection.</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>As I read books like Destiny Disrupted (brilliant by the way) or pretty much anything by Karen Armstrong, I am struck by these differences. At the time of the founders these religions were truly alive, and followers and exogenous events were directly part of whole shebang.</p><br>
<p>By contrast, the experience nowadays seems a lot more passive, of interpretation and extrapolation. Although there are some exceptions, such as some Christian denominations&#8217; belief in a personal relationship with god.</p><br>
<p>But Mohammad was consulted by his followers and the revelations even shaped battle strategy. The community was not only driven, but provided direct feedback.</p><br>
<p>Barring exceptions like the Ten Commandments, the narrative of the Bible also delivers a stream of guidance in reaction to outside stimuli. But, again, all of this stops once the key figures (notably Jesus) die. We are left with an ossified husk of their teaching.</p><br>
<p>Actually, worse, as access to these teachings were weaponised in the pursuit of power for hundreds of years.</p><br>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>&#8230;Overall though, lessons from the Age of Mass Migration suggest that fears that immigrants cannot or will not fit into American society are misplaced.  It would be a mistake to determine immigration policy based on the belief that immigrants will remain foreigners, preserving their old ways of life  and keeping themselves at arm’s length from the dominant  culture. <strong>The evidence suggests that over time immigrant populations come to resemble natives, and that new generations form distinct identities as Americans</strong>&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<p>Not sure about using names as a proxy for &quot;foreigness&quot;, but it&#8217;s an <a href="https://people.stanford.edu/ranabr/sites/default/files/cultural_assimilation.pdf">interesting paper</a> that is in line with other research in this area. Particularly notable are the results for lower socioeconomic immigrants, given the emphasis on skilled migration in so many countries.</p><br>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;We compare the cultural assimilation of immigrants during two waves of mass migration to the United States, the first from Europe and the second from Asia and Latin America. Using five million census records from 1920 and 1940, and nearly ten million California birth certificate  records  between 1989  and 2015, we start by constructing a “foreignness index” indicating  the  probability that a given name is held by a foreigner or a native at the time the name was given&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;In both periods, <strong>cultural assimilation is somewhat faster for immigrants from lower socioeconomic status.</strong> The rapid pace of cultural assimilation observed in our names-based measure is consistent with other indicators, including learning to speak English, applying for US citizenship, and marrying spouses from different origins&#8230;</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/legitimisation-of-tattooing/" class="post-header">Legitimisation of tattooing</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>For American settlers, tattooing would have been most closely associated with Native Americans or criminals, and deemed unacceptable for “civilized” people&#8230;.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But that first started to change during the Revolutionary War. American sailors decorated themselves with symbols of their newborn country—the “goddess” Columbia, the face of George Washington, the American flag. For these sailors a patriotic tattoo served both as personal and group identification&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;The Civil War helped tattooing begin a transition from the military to wider society, and ushered in the style of classic tattooing unique to America. Tattooing had long been widespread among sailors, but during the war men who would never have considered getting a tattoo before wanted a way to show their allegiance to their cause and to identify themselves in the event of death.</p><br>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>
<p>competition should not be defined by some arbitrary number of producers, but by whether other firms are free to enter the market. <strong>Ultimately, market entry is the key prerequisite of innovation</strong>. If the state imposes constraints on that freedom in such a way as to establish or maintain a single private or public producer’s market dominance, then it has created a harmful monopoly, by severely limiting opportunities for innovation.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure I agree with this&#8230; This may be true for most goods but does not factor in the global, network effects of online spaces.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us return to the EU’s recent actions. The Commission levied its June 2017 fine because Google prioritized its own “comparative shopping service” over those of its competitors. And yet, anyone who uses Google and its various services does so freely, not because Google is somehow forcing them. They could just as well use other services, so <strong>their decision to use Google must mean that Google provides the service most useful to them</strong>.</p><br>
