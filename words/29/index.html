<h1><a href="/words/the-flipside-of-palm-oil/" class="post-header">The flipside of palm oil</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3040400">interesting new paper</a> suggests that the Indonesian palm oil industry has made a significant dent in rural poverty.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;my most conservative estimate suggests at least 1.3 million out of the approximately 10 million people lifted from poverty over the 2000s have escaped poverty due to growth in the oil palmsector. Poverty gaps significantly narrow, suggesting not only those near the poverty line are being lifted up.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, as several <a href="https://twitter.com/kmac/status/912612638089031681">have pointed out on Twitter</a>, this is not an optimal method of development. Beyond the environmental damage you have negative impacts on health and a lack of incentive to invest in capital and human capital.</p><br>
<p>However, there are peculiarities of the palm oil industry that break in its favour. Palm oil production has a greater positive impact on poverty than other crops. One of the reasons is that palm oil has to be processed within twenty four hours, leading to decentralised infrastructure.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The observed poverty reduction can be explained by more rapid increases in household expenditures for people in the bottom quintile and agriculture, and through greater provision of public goods most related to agricultural manufacturing, specifically roads and electricity.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Indonesia’s over 1600 palm oil mills each buy fresh fruit bunches fromdozens of villages, often through a complex network of traders providing important aggregation and logistical functions for independent smallholders and farmer groups needing to get their fruit to the mill within 24 hours of harvesting. Urgent processing requirements mean the area feedingeach mill is roughly a 50 kilometer radius.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<p>All that being said (and I recommend reading the paper in full), there is one big takeaway. Roughly 90% of recent increases in production have come from expansion in land use, and the large number of small holders are significantly less efficient than the larger operators.</p><br>
<p>Part of this is due to economies of scale that the smallholders can’t achieve. But with so many of our products containing palm oil, one way to tackle the environmental problem may be to invest in Indonesian smallholders to raise productivity.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Yield maximizing practices relate to pest management, fertilizer application, pruning, and harvesting at the optimal time&#8230; The key on-farm technology is seed quality, determined at the planting stage&#8230; Roughly two laborers are needed for every five hectares of Indonesia’s current 7 million hectares of industrial plantations.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/Journalism-has-a-presentation-problem/" class="post-header">Journalism has a presentation problem</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the biggest issues with modern journalism is that framing is overvalued and understanding is undervalued. This is true not just in practice, but also in the way it is taught.</p><br>
<p>Look at any journalism course in Australia and you’ll find that subject knowledge is discounted in favour of presentation skills. Internships and practical media projects are favoured over electives in other academic disciplines &#8211; statistics, economics, medicine etc.</p><br>
<p>This came to mind as I read the <a href="https://t.co/RieFIY6gXE?ssr=true">last of Nate Silver’s essays</a> on the 2016 election.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent elections, the media has often overestimated the precision of polling, cherry-picked data and portrayed elections as sure things when that conclusion very much wasn’t supported by polls or other empirical evidence.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>By teaching journalists that their job is packaging the ideas and actions of others, the medium inevitably becomes constrained. What is good presentation exactly? Among other things it’s putting things as simply as possible.</p><br>
<p>On the one hand this is a good thing &#8211; it makes the news widely accessible. On other other, simplification can itself be misleading. Condensing dozens of pages of a working paper, or decades of iterative academic theory, by necessity requires the subtraction of nuance. This is what Nate Silver identifies in his latest piece.</p><br>
<p>Experts provided myriad caveats to their forecasts in the 2016 election. But constrained by their job as packagers, journalists provided only certainty. By banishing the details as boring or irrelevant, trying to get a clear angle, we were systematically misled.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>”While many things about the 2016 election were surprising, the fact that Trump narrowly won1 when polls had him narrowly trailing was an utterly routine and unremarkable occurrence. The outcome was well within the “cone of uncertainty,” so to speak.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>But a narrowing of the role is only part of the problem. One of my friends is currently studying journalism and recently completed a course on data journalism. While this taught her a great deal on telling stories with data, she has little idea of what data to use or when, There were no economics, demographic, health etc. components of her course to provide her with the context surrounding the data.</p><br>
<p>This narrowing of expertise by definition curtails what stories are told. A bunch of technical skills are being dumped on the market with little subject knowledge to act as guidance to what exactly is a story. It also means these journalists are at the mercy of the very experts they end up packaging.</p><br>
<p>Now, of course, this whole argument is a great generalisation and misses many wonderful journalists. Especially older journalists who have spent time in the field and built up subject knowledge. But having spent much of the past decade around young and upcoming journalists, Silver’s analysis reads incredibly true. And it’s very worrying.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/The-economy-is-everything/" class="post-header">The economy is everything</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With Australia currently engaged in an <a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/same-sex-marriage-plebiscite-29871">abysmal debate</a> over same sex marriage, it‘s refreshing to be reminded that morality often has a utilitarian history.</p><br>
<p>For example, <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp10969.pdf">this</a> recent paper suggests that norms around illegitimate children are based in economics.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on data from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and modern Austria,<br />
we show that regions that focused on animal husbandry (as compared to crop farming) had significantly higher illegitimacy ratios in the past, and female descendants of these societies are still more likely to approve illegitimacy and give birth outside of marriage today.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>The key point is actually buried a fair bit down in the paper. The reason there is this split in social norms between crop and animal farming communities is apparently due to differing labor structures.</p><br>
<p>18th and 19th century workers on crop farms were on short term contracts, often working as day labourers.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>In crop farming, the work load and the resulting demand for additional<br />
labor, is determined by the rhythm of the seasons&#8230; additional manpower is needed in the harvest season.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Workers on animal farms, meanwhile, had long term contracts. This was less precarious, but they also tended to live on the farms and so had little opportunity to create their own households. Their illegitimate children were tolerated by the communities.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, in animal husbandry the workload is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year&#8230; Animal husbandry requires a sound knowledge of the peculiarities of each animal (analogous to firm-specific human capital), while harvesting is less specific.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/the-diminishing-returns-of-research/" class="post-header">The diminishing returns of research</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>&quot;Innovation&quot; has become a political/economic <a href="https://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda">panacea</a> over the past few years. But an <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23782?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw">interesting paper</a> suggests that research also obeys the laws of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/diminishing-returns">diminishing returns</a>. Research productivity in the United States has declined spectacularly in the last few decades.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example is Moore&#8217;s Law. The number of researchers required today to achieve the famous doubling every two years of the density of computer chips is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper is mainly aimed at updating endogenous growth models, which assume that research exhibits constant returns. But the examples given &#8211; declining research productivity in technology, medicine and the economy as a whole, have huge implications for those thinking we can just chuck a bunch of researchers onto the problem of stagnating growth.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>We find that research productivity for the aggregate U.S. economy has declined by a factor of 41 since the 1930s, an average decrease of more than 5% per year</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Averaging across all our samples, research productivity falls at a rate of about 9% per year, cumulating to a 2.5-fold decline every decade. At this rate, research productivity declines by a factor of about 15 over three decades of changes; put differently, it requires 15 times more researchers today than it did 30 years ago to produce the same&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t just need to chuck more brains at this problem. We need to use our brains to deploy those brains.</p><br>
