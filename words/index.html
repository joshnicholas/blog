<h1><a href="/blog/words/consuming-not-learning/" class="post-header">consuming, not learning</a></h1>




<p><p>It seems like it’s never been easier to be an autodidact. Endless wikis, videos and articles are a search away. And they’re (mostly) free. All you need is the will. Supposedly.</p><p>Learning is probably the closest thing I have to a hobby. But I struggle to learn on the internet. And I think it’s because I’ve been consuming, not learning.</p><p>There’s a lot wrong with formal education. But besides the pieces of paper you get at the end (the currency of Human Resources), the best of formal education is the guidance of someone who has achieved mastery. Especially, guidance (compulsion) to practice.</p><p>Most online resources I’ve come across are instead geared around consumption. Even if there’s a “curriculum” there’s rarely an emphasis on practice. On building reps. Rarer still are explorations of what makes effective practice.</p><p>At best this is a recipe for mere familiarity. At worst it leads to stagnation, frustration and abandonment.</p><p>They aren’t all like this. When I was an undergrad I did a lot of Khan Academy to brush up on maths. There were seemingly endless practice problems and you couldn’t progress until you showed some level of “mastery”.</p><p>This seems obvious for a well trod, ostensibly linear path like maths. But repetition is the basis for learning pretty much anything. And it’s missing from a lot of the internet’s learning materials.</p><p>In the past couple of years I’ve gone deep on painting and drawing. YouTube has a fantastic catalogue of art videos, as do platforms like Skillshare or Domestika.</p><p>But you’re more likely to go down a rabbit hole of product reviews as anything else. My first months of painting were a mess of Amazon packages as I tried different brands and gadgets, even as my skills largely stagnated.</p><p>One of the longest videos in a course I recently purchased was about the teacher’s favourite tools. It was almost twice as long as the video on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective</a>.</p><p>Even when there are exercises attached to the lessons, there is often little on how to make it generalisable. How to self critique and correct.</p><p>The breadth of my knowledge of watercolour brands is now truly staggering. I own some really expensive brushes. But, years into my watercolour journey, I’m still unsure how I should practice.</p><p>Because I’ve been consuming, not learning.</p></p>

<h1><a href="/blog/words/centring-curiosity/" class="post-header">Centring curiosity</a></h1>




<p><p>There’s some sampling bias in how often biographies I read centre curiosity. But I wonder if it’s more my choice of reading material, than it is the kind of people who get biographies.</p><p>I started reading a <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/code-breaker-jennifer-doudna-gene-editing-and-the-future-of-the-human-race/oclc/1241436277">new biography</a> of Jennifer Doudna. She won a Nobel prize for her work on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a>.</p><p>Almost immediately we run into her being an outsider as a child, her diverse interests. Her <strong>curiosity</strong>.</p><blockquote>“Her work also illustrates, as Leonardo da Vinci’s did, that the key to innovation is <strong>connecting a curiosity</strong> about basic science to the practical work of devising tools that can be applied to our lives - moving discoveries from lab bench to bedside.”</blockquote><p>CRISPR is something I know little about, bar a half remembered Radio Lab episode from a few years ago. So I’m really excited to read more, and whether this pays off.</p><p>But this does look promising:</p><blockquote>“Curiosity-driven research into the wonders of nature plants the seeds, sometimes in unpredictable ways, for later innovations. Research about surface-state physics eventually led to the transistor and microchip. Likewise, studies of an astonishing method that bacteria use to fight off viruses eventually led to a gene-editing tool and techniques that humans can use in their own struggle against viruses.”</blockquote></p>

<h1><a href="/blog/words/we-really-dont-know-why-it-happened/" class="post-header">We (really) don’t know why it happened</a></h1>




<p><p>Fulfilment at work comes from mastery, and the perks that go with it, rather than pre-existing passion. That’s my main takeaway from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love/oclc/1120678544&amp;referer=brief_results">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a> by Cal Newport.</p><p>There isn’t much earth shattering in it. But it’s a great example of a simple inversion of a “common sense” idea. And the power of, and need for, different framing.</p><p>But a side note in the book is what has really captured my thinking the past few days:</p><blockquote>There was debate in the chess world at the time surrounding the best strategies for improving. One camp thought tournament play was crucial, as it provides practice with tight time limits and working through distractions. The other camp, however, emphasized serious study—pouring over books and using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses. When surveyed, the participants in Charness’s study thought tournament play was probably the right answer. <strong>The participants, as it turns out, were wrong</strong>. Hours spent in serious study of the game was not just the most important factor in predicting chess skill, it dominated the other factors.</blockquote><p>That we don’t fully understand or appreciate the reasons for successes (or failures) is something I’ve often returned to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/a-plea-for-more-humility-about-what-we-know/">since reading The Hidden Half</a>.</p><p>That book largely focused on noise and unknowability. Newport concentrates on poor framing and mental capture.</p><p>I started reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/serendipity-mindset-the-art-and-science-of-creating-good-lu/oclc/1199009413&amp;referer=brief_results">The Serendipity Mindset</a> this morning and came across yet another spin. This is a book largely focused on luck (“serendipity”), and our perceptions of it.</p><blockquote>The point is that when we construct our story of past events, we do what forecasters do: we create a model and ignore the details and the random events. Forecasters have a good excuse for doing this with the future: they cannot model every detail and, by definition, cannot foresee unpredictable events. But what is our excuse for doing this with the past?..</blockquote><blockquote>...We downplay or exclude the unpredictable events from our version of the past because <strong>random events that happened are no longer unpredictable</strong>. In fact, in hindsight they can start to look like they were inevitable. We then use information that wasn’t available to us at the time, and construct narratives that conveniently explain everything, including how each piece of the story logically connects with the rest of the story.</blockquote><p>The overarching thread is the stories we tell ourselves are wrong. Whether due to an inability to perceive, ingrained misdirection, motivated reasoning, an uncomfortableness with randomness, post hoc rationalisation, or something else.</p><p>Eyewitness accounts seem to receive less and less credence as evidence of flaws mount. But perhaps all stories should be treated thus.</p></p>

<h1><a href="/blog/words/how-do-you-foster-an-intrinsic-motivation-to-learn/" class="post-header">How do you foster an intrinsic motivation to learn?</a></h1>




<p><p>I recently got the results for my latest masters courses and I’m doing pretty well. But I don’t <em>really</em> care. I’ve never been particularly motivated by grades. As long as they are high enough that I can keep studying whatever I want.</p><p>The results came as I started reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/bigger-prize-why-competition-isnt-everything-and-how-we-do-better/oclc/896906563&amp;referer=brief_results">A bigger prize</a> by Margaret Heffernan. It’s a deep dive into competition. Specifically, the way we have unquestioningly inserted competition into so many aspects of life even as we keep discovering the benefits (to creativity, health, equality etc.) of cooperation.</p><p>In one early chapter Heffernan describes an experiment into kids’ motivation at school. And it really stopped me short. Wondering how I had lucked into an intrinsic motivation to learn, rather than needing to be baited with gold stars.</p><blockquote>In the original experiment, a bunch of nursery school children were divided into three groups and given the opportunity to draw. The first group was promised a reward: if they drew, they’d win a certificate. The second group was told nothing – but was surprised by a certificate when it had finished drawing. The third group just drew and received nothing for its labours. Two weeks later, the children were again confronted by paper and pens. Now the question was: which group would want to draw? The group that had initially been promised a reward was the least engaged: <strong>why should they draw when there was no certificate on offer</strong>?</blockquote><blockquote>Similar experiments have been conducted with different ages, tasks and rewards, in different industries and countries around the world, but the results don’t vary. Grades, stars, certificates, money, trophies: ‘<strong>virtually every type of expected tangible reward made contingent on task performance does, in fact, undermine intrinsic motivation</strong>.’</blockquote><p>This quickly feeds into rumination on divergent thinking, the problems with exams, and the link between education and creativity. But I’d like to stop here for now.</p><p>I need to look more into these studies. They seem directionally in line with what we see in society. Most people seem to stop learning when they finish school or university. Outside of that a lot is probably motivated by specific goals - qualifying for a job etc. But is this because we have subconsciously trained people to require short term positive reinforcement in order to learn?</p><p>Even the HBR-esque calls for lifelong learning are couched in these terms. I rarely ever see advocates for learning because learning itself is good. Education is expensive, fair enough. But its precisely the non-rewards-based education that is the cheapest. Wikipedia is almost free, for example.</p><p>Heffernan’s solution is to overhaul the structure of schools to remove aspects like testing, ranking and their links to teacher pay. Eliminate some of the competition, as is the main thrust of her book. But I’m not sure I completely buy it. I don’t know what the answer is.</p><p><em>My emphasis.</em></p></p>

<h1><a href="/blog/words/the-context-of-colour/" class="post-header">The context of colour</a></h1>




<p><p>We’re surrounded by colour. On TV, advertising and clothes. I can whip open an app and conjure countless hues. We have wonderful algorithms that can interpolate from grainy, black and white footage.</p><p>But, reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/color-a-natural-history-of-the-palette/oclc/841330570"><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/color-a-natural-history-of-the-palette/oclc/841330570">Color</a></a> by Victoria Finlay, gives you an appreciation of how unusual this is. How colour was rooted in place, politics, science, superstition, tradition, myth, adventure, disaster, exploitation, geology, biology and time.</p><p>And that isn’t an exhaustive list. As our use of colour has exploded, we’ve lost so much of this context.</p><blockquote>With the exception of a few Russian icons which may have been painted with blue from Siberia, all the real ultramarine in both Western and Eastern art came from the last of these places—from one set of mines in a valley in north-east Afghanistan, collectively called Sar-e-sang, the Place of the Stone. It was where the Buddha’s topknots came from; it was where the monk painters of illuminated manuscripts found their skies; it was where the robe of Michelangelo’s Mother of God would have come from if he had waited long enough. And it was where I was determined to go.</blockquote><p>Wars were fought over shades. Masterpieces left incomplete when artists couldn’t afford particular hues. Espionage was rampant as countries competed for monopolies.</p><p>This is a fascinating book, part travelogue part history. Finlay physically journeys to find ochre in Northern Australia, cochineal insect farms in South America, and the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan.</p><p>But I was probably taken most with what’s lost. Many of the works lining our national galleries have changed since they were completed. Natural pigment often isn’t permanent. And nor are the techniques to make them.</p><p>I carry around a little box of watercolours nowadays. In case I can get in a quick sketch. But now I realise they’re more than burnt umbers or cerulean blue. It’s a box of stories.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>“I can’t draw at all - I cant even draw stick men!” This is something I hear a lot. It’s always adults who say it - never children. <strong>Children haven’t yet learned to prejudge their drawing skills</strong> and so allow themselves to just give it a try.</blockquote><p>This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/sketching-people-an-urban-sketchers-guide-to-drawing-figures-and-faces/">Sketching People</a>. But it could easily have been in <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/changing-perspectives/">any</a> of the drawing books I’ve <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-cant-you-draw/">read recently</a>.</p><p>Our own minds are such a barrier to learning that every book is compelled to justify their very existence. To insist that drawing skills, like almost anything, aren’t an inherent trait. That they can be mastered with time, practice and study.</p><p>Of course some people are <em>gifted</em>. They pick up things quicker and achieve heights the rest of us seem incapable. But just because I may never eclipse Ray Allen’s free throw percentage (<a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html">89%</a>) doesn’t mean I can’t become insanely good. And even he had to earn the first 80, (85?) percent the same as the rest of us.</p><p>When do people learn to make perfection a barrier to even trying?

<h1><a href="/blog/words/how-many-stories-are-we-missing/" class="post-header">How many stories are we missing?</a></h1>




<p><p>I recently stumbled across the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/gabriel-campanario-seattle-sketcher/">sketch column</a> of Gabriel Campanario in the Seattle Times. The archive goes back a decade and is full of lovely art. But he's also using the medium to tell stories, and capture emotion and feeling, in ways others can't.</p><p>The stillness in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/microsofts-treehouse-workspaces-hold-the-fort-until-employees-return/">this recent column</a> on Microsoft's campus during the pandemic, for instance:</p><blockquote>Tucked away between buildings 31 and 32 in the northeast corner of the tech company’s sprawling campus, the lofty wooden huts served as meeting spaces and inspiration zones in precoronavirus times. For now, the treehouses stand empty, waiting for the eventual return of the employees who have been working from home for months.</blockquote><p>I've never been to Seattle. I've seen it on tv and in movies, but these sketches and explorations ground it as more than a backdrop. Some of it is the focus on the <em>mundane</em>, like markets, bookstores and small parks.</p><p>Sketching and watercolour capture moments in time. But unlike photography they force the creator to be present for an extended period. To measure, estimate and contrast. To notice little details and features most of us walk past every day.</p><p>And, consequently, they force the viewer to do these things too.</p><p>Campanario has used this to document <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/10-sketches-that-show-how-seattle-has-changed-over-the-last-decade/">change</a>, explore <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/two-opposing-buildings-on-this-capitol-hill-street-tell-the-story-of-new-vs-old-seattle-at-one-glance/">class</a> and highlight <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/this-hidden-park-in-tacoma-honors-the-journey-chinese-immigrants-took-to-the-united-states/">microhistories</a> throughout Seattle. The buildings, the infrastructure, are themselves the characters. Just as they are in our lives.</p><p>Pen and brush can explore lines, space, value and visual juxtaposition. They can exaggerate and simplify. In ways others just don't have to. In ways others can't. That is the strength of this column. But Campanario's work is also an example of what we've lost as media companies have shrunk, as stories have become faster, more national and international.</p><p>How many others are there with the license to slowly explore and document our built world? Our local world? How many stories are we missing?</p></p>

<h1><a href="/blog/words/changing-perspectives/" class="post-header">Changing perspectives</a></h1>




<p><p>I was hurrying across the shopping centre this morning when a painting stopped me. It was a print. A generic composition of an urban scene. You’ve seen it. A street disappears into the horizon, lined with lovingly water-coloured buildings.</p><p>The scene itself was forgettable. But I was engrossed. I located the vanishing point and traced perspective lines along the rooftops and windows. I was counting gradients, absorbing the contrasts.</p><p>I was, I realised, entirely focused on the mechanics. I was trying to figure out how it was constructed. Looking past its impact and into the raw execution. This is a new one for me.</p><p>I’ve been <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/why-cant-you-draw/">reading</a> and watching a lot on sketching and drawing recently. But even as my scribbles have <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/flowerpot2/">improved somewhat</a>, my whole approach has apparently, drastically, changed. I think about it more. I consider the process.</p><p>I’ve been frustrated at my slow progress. Even as I manically draw box figures and practice laying down values. But while my eye, dexterity and muscle memory aren’t there, I have come a long way. My perspective has changed.</p><p>It’s really easy to be caught up with the ending and ignore the journey. <em>Resultism</em>, I think it’s called. “Lifelong learning” is steeped in credentialism and “if you learn X you can finally do Y”. But it’s often these little changes in perspective that stick with you.</p><p>I studied economics in uni and can barely remember any of the models. But I regularly employ concepts like opportunity cost and marginalism. Learning, processing, radically changed how I think and approach subjects.</p><p>Maybe I’ll never be able to properly shade a sketch into appearing three dimensional. But I can see the value in trying to. Lifelong learning could just be about luxuriating in these tiny changes in perspective.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>Education researchers have known for decades that <strong>being good at something and being good at teaching something are two completely different skill sets</strong>. In fact, universities are mostly ranked on the strength of their research, and, of course, the brand name can be worth a lot. Something similar holds true for MasterClass, whose impressive roster of talent feels like a who’s who of elite professionals, a gallery of the meritocracy’s winners.</blockquote><p>The easy, obvious heuristics are, often, just so bad. How many simple signals of what’s good or proper are actually just status quo bias rather than reliable indicators we should use to make decisions?</p><p>From an interesting <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/what-is-masterclass-actually-selling/614200/">article on Masterclass</a> in The Atlantic.</p><p><em>My emphasis</em>.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>To make significant progress in drawing, it is important to be aware of your strengths and challenges. Don’t just say, “I’m not good at drawing faces.” Try to learn specifically why you find it challenging to draw faces? Is it getting the proportions right? Shading? Anatomy?

The clearer you are, the better prepared you will be for devising a solution.</blockquote><p>This is another gem from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/pen-and-ink-drawing-a-simple-guide/oclc/1032832501&amp;referer=brief_results">Pen and ink drawing: a simple guide</a>.</p><p>I don't really think much of my drawing skills. That's why I like the word "scribble". I am always getting better, though.</p><p>So many don't even get past the first step. I regularly ask others to join me. But my invitations and provocations are usually, immediately, shut down with "I can't draw".</p><p>They're apparently so bad it's not worth bothering at all.
