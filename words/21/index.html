<h1><a href="/words/working-with-diverse-teams/" class="post-header">Working with diverse teams</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The notion that diverse teams come up with more creative solutions (or at least ones that better reflect a diverse audience/customer base) seems to be pretty widespread. But how does it work in practice?</p><br>
<p>Some <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0001839214563975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting research</a> out of America suggests that &#8220;political correctness&#8221; may be necessary to make it work:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Our research shows that men and women both experience uncertainty when asked to generate ideas as members of a mixed-sex work group: men because they may fear offending the women in the group and women because they may fear having their ideas devalued or rejected. <strong>Most group creativity research begins with the assumption that creativity is unleashed by removing normative constraints, but our results show that the PC norm promotes rather than suppresses the free expression of ideas by reducing the uncertainty experienced by both sexes</strong> in mixed-sex work groups and signaling that the group is predictable enough to risk sharing more—and more-novel—ideas.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>The researchers did a couple of interesting experiments, priming students with politically correct norms. There appears to be a negative affect in homogeneous groups, but in mixed groups it produced a marked increase in &#8220;creativity&#8221;.</p><br>
<p>What I appreciate about this research is the light touch. It fits with the view of political correctness as a form of decency. Like any notion of decency (swearing for instance), there can be social sanction, but the limitations also breed their own form of freedom.</p><br>
<p>We know how to act, and, more importantly, how not to. If you care about not making others uncomfortable then the restriction can be freeing.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/gender-inequality-and-linguistic-determinism/" class="post-header">Gender inequality and linguistic determinism</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Our preferred specification suggests that <strong>grammatical gender is associated with a 12 percentage point reduction in women’s labor force participation and an almost 15 percentage point increase in the gender gap in labor force participation</strong>. These associations are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of geo-graphic controls (including suitability for the plough) that could not plausibly have beenimpacted by language. Taken at face value, our coefficient estimates suggest that<strong> gender languages keep approximately 125 million women around the world out of the labor force.</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<p>Stumbled across this <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/405621528167411253/Gendered-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fantastic paper</a> about the subtle affect that grammar can have on how we think. In this case, languages that sort nouns into gendered categories are associated with poorer labour market outcomes for women.</p><br>
<p>It reminds me of <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.2.690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar research</a> showing that people from language groups that don&#8217;t clearly separate the future from the present (such as German) &#8220;save more, retire with more wealth, smoke less, practice safer sex, and are less obese&#8221;.</p><br>
<p>And it seems to fit with the findings from many other fields:</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Our results are consistent with research in psychology, linguistics, and anthropology suggesting that <strong>languages shape patterns of thought in subtle and subconscious ways&#8230;. </strong></p><br></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<p>It all comes back to my <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/time-to-update-our-democratic-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main takeaway from The Heretics</a>: we really don&#8217;t have a good working model for how we form beliefs, make decisions or even behave. There are profound contextual factors affecting all of these. I&#8217;m not sure how we fix this.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/time-to-update-our-democratic-models/" class="post-header">Time to update our democratic models</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Throughout childhood and until late adolescence, our brains are building their internal models of what is out there and how it all works –physical, social, emotional and so on. After that, <strong>our core beliefs harden and we find change</strong>, according to Professor of Psychiatry Bruce Wexler, <strong>‘difficult and painful’.</strong> The <strong>power of our many cognitive biases skews our view. We attack unwelcome information</strong>. The gravity of our personal worlds attracts us to other, similar worlds –people who ‘see it like we do’, whose opinions give us the warm, reassuring pleasure of comfort, familiarity, safety. <strong>It all thickens the illusion that our way is the trueway.</strong></p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/heretics-adventures-with-the-enemies-of-science/oclc/815365740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Heretics</a> by Will Storr. It&#8217;s part investigation, part memoir, as Storr embeds with homeopaths, faith healers, neo nazis and others with &#8220;weird beliefs&#8221;.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m slowly going through my notes and may pull out some more, but the thing that consistently struck me throughout is what this means for institutional design.</p><br>
<p>Our democracies absolutely were not built, and have not evolved, with our more sophisticated understanding of how people build beliefs and make decisions. How fallible our memories are, how we capitulate to group think, react and then build post hoc justifications (etc.).</p><br>
<p>Meanwhile those who wish to take advantage of us certainly have.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>In that strange, chemical and alchemical moment when an unconscious decision is made about what to believe, how much is genetic, how much is rational, how much is concerned solely with reinforcing our dearly held models of the world? And how does personality collide with all of this? How does the character of the decider – all that complex emotionality, the calculation of possible outcomes, the current state of mind, the kaleidoscope of motives, the autobiographical heromission – pollute the process? With these questions, we have struck rock. There is no answer.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/how-should-we-frame-foreign-aid/" class="post-header">How should we frame foreign aid?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve always been inclined to frame foreign aid in purely self interest terms &#8211; helping others makes us all safer, preventing disease etc. But if we want our governments to increase foreign aid is that the best argument?</p><br>
<p>Terence Wood and Chris Hoy from the Australian National University have done an <a href="http://devpolicy.org/publications/discussion_papers/DP75-Helping.us.or.helping.them.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting study</a> on precisely this issue:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>All of the treatments, including the basic treatment, increased general approval of aid giving (by roughly ten percentage points) and decreased the percentage of the population who thought Australia gave too much aid by a similar extent. <strong>Simply providing people with some tangible detail about what aid is doing, and coupling this with endorsement from an independent expert, is enough to have a substantial impact on support for aid. </strong>The specific way aid is framed – basic information, appeals to national interest, altruism, etc. – doesn’t seem to matter much for these improvements.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>These are from their <a href="http://www.devpolicy.org/whats-more-effective-in-raising-support-for-aid-20190110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev policy blog post</a> about their paper. (My emphasis)</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Increasing the share of Australians who thought Australia gives too little aid was more difficult though. Only the altruism and national interest treatments brought statistically significant increases, and the increases were only in the vicinity of about five percentage points.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more to this story &#8211; for one the authors note that this is complicated by what participants believed the intention of the project is. But at the very least this confirms that low information is a major problem and seemingly any discussion is a good discussion.</p><br>
