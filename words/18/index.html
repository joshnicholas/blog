<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/02/26/if-years-of.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fascinating line</a> in the opening pages of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/heres-looking-at-euclid-a-surprising-excursion-through-the-astonishing-world-of-math/oclc/893133085&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By age 16, school kids have learned almost no math beyond what was already known in the mid-seventeenth century, and likewise <strong>by the time they are 18 they have not gone beyond the mid-eighteenth century</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the point of schooling is to teach the current best understanding of the world, we appear to be failing.</p>
<p>Granted, maths is unlike science in that the old ways are built upon rather than overturned. We still learn Pythagoras theorem but not geocentrism.</p>
<p>This necessitates teaching newer mathematical discoveries <em>in addition</em> to what came before it. But is there really no recent mathematical discovery that would be useful to learn in school? Or at least help us shape more rounded adults, equipped for the modern world? <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/another-adjacent-possible/">Boolean algebra</a> mayhaps?</p>
<p>I was thinking about this as I came across the following passage in <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-are-school-tests-trying-to-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lady Tasting Tea</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As measurements became more and more precise, more and more error cropped up. The clockwork universe lay in shambles. Attempts to discover the laws of biology and sociology had failed. In the older sciences like physics and chemistry, the laws that Newton and Laplace had used were proving to be only rough approximations. <strong>Gradually, science began to work with a new paradigm, the statistical model of reality</strong>. By the end of the twentieth century, almost all of science had shifted to using statistical models&#8230; <strong>Popular culture has failed to keep up with this scientific revolution</strong>. Some vague ideas and expressions (like &#8220;correlation,&#8221; &#8220;odds,&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221;) have drifted into the popular vocabulary, and most people are aware of the uncertainties associated with some areas of science like medicine and economics, but few nonscientists have any understanding of the profound shift in philosophical view that has occurred</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely my experience that people are more comfortable with a deterministic model of the universe than a probabilistic one. But why are so many of us stuck in old paradigms even as our world has become immensely sophisticated and complicated?</p>
<p>If nothing else, a more widespread probabilistic model would lead to more nuanced discussions around new research and challenges like climate change. A more modern understanding of mathematics would help us all get the most of technological advances.</p>
<p>Many of the books I&#8217;ve read criticising modern education see it as a relic of the industrial revolution and empire, geared towards producing identical widgets to keep things running smoothly. Can&#8217;t help thinking that&#8217;s right. And we haven&#8217;t changed it much.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/winners-rewrite-history-redux/" class="post-header">‘Winners’ [re]write history</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Growing up in Australia I barely remember learning about Indigenous history. Certainly not the very recent history of settlement and colonialism.</p>
<p>It was probably in there somewhere. But my teachers obviously had a greater affection for World War 2 and Ancient Egypt than the very present and living history of a displaced people.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDemography/status/1102421503839072256?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&#8217;m not alone</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the wounds are still raw, and the conversation around trauma and reverberations <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/kyle-sandilands-says-academics-are-rewriting-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so appalling</a>.</p>
<p>But every now and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we get reminders</a> of how awful it was:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this first snapshot of the continent, we have found that there were at least 270 frontier massacres over 140 years, as part of a <strong>state-sanctioned and organised attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Starting in 1794, mass killings were first carried out by British soldiers, then by police and settlers – often acting together – and later by native police, working under the command of white officers, in militia-style forces supported by colonial governments.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are still Australians who were alive when these policies were in effect. The massacres <a href="https://theconversation.com/amp/of-course-australia-was-invaded-massacres-happened-here-less-than-90-years-ago-55377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were ongoing</a> a decade after World War 1, an <a href="https://tasa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Donoghue-Jed-Session-13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">important point in Australia&#8217;s national identity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;large-scale massacres of Aboriginal people were still being carried out through the 1920s and early 1930s in some parts of Australia.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Australian media descends into another disingenuous kvetch over this issue, it&#8217;s worthwhile to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remember where our priors come from</a>.</p>
<p>Most of us, notably the non-Indigenous Australians, have experienced this history in an abstract way. Through the poor representations in school and the media.</p>
<p>Winners write the history? They also write the curriculum.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/what-happens-when-you-ban-headscarves/" class="post-header">What happens when you ban headscarves?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>We ﬁnd that the law <strong>reduces the secondary educational attainment of Muslim girls, and impacts their trajectory in the labor market and family composition in the long run</strong>. We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased perceptions of discrimination and that it <strong>reduces assimilation by casting religion and national identities as incompatible</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a recent <a href="https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/abdelgadirfoukajan2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working paper</a> looking at a 2004 French law that banned &#8220;religious signs&#8221; in primary and secondary schools. It affected many religions, but was essentially a de facto ban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in school.</p>
<p>These bans are purportedly to encourage assimilation and a homogenisation of values. But study authors Aala Abdelgadir and Vasiliki Fouka find that it can actually intensify a minority sense of identity.</p>
<p>Which makes sense. I&#8217;m struggling to think of a ban on anything that actually changed minds. Some part of the population will follow the decree because they believe in it already. Others will stomach it. And the rest will contravene and reap the consequences/rewards.</p>
<p>In cases like murder, the benefits of a ban outweigh the consequences for the individual. For <em>some</em> drugs, the tide seems to be shifting in the other direction.</p>
<p>But do the benefits of forced cultural homogenisation really outweigh the consequences for these women and their families? Especially given they could rebound for generations?</p>
<blockquote><p>We measure educational and socioeconomic outcomes of French-born women with parents from Muslim-majority countries who were just old enough to have been at school when the law was enacted, and compare them to older cohorts who did not experience the ban, and to a variety of control groups, including non-Muslim immigrants and Muslim men.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Our ﬁrst ﬁnding is that <strong>exposure to the ban signiﬁcantly reduces the likelihood of completing secondary education</strong>. Part of this eﬀect appears to be driven by a negative impact on enrollment rates in secondary school for Muslim women aged 16 and above&#8230; We also ﬁnd that Muslim <strong>women aﬀected by the ban took longer to complete secondary education</strong>, conditional on their pre-existing age-educational proﬁles. These higher dropout rates and longer completion times indicate that the ban disrupted the educational progress of Muslim girls. This negative educational shock carries over to a <strong>number of longer term outcomes, such as labor force participation, employment rates, and fertility patterns</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These women and families were wearing scarves for a legitimate reason <em>to them</em>. That a top-down approach is destined to fail is driven home by the mechanism by which this all occurred:</p>
<blockquote><p>We show that these longer run eﬀects of the ban work through two hypothesized pathways: a discrimination channel, and an identity channel. First, women aﬀected by the ban <strong>report increased perceptions of discrimination at school and a lower trust in the French school system</strong>&#8230; Second.. Muslim women were forced to <strong>choose between a secular French identity and attachment to their religious practices</strong>, a conﬂict that often led to alienation from the French society. In the data, Muslim women aﬀected by the ban increase their identiﬁcation with the nationality of their father relatively more than their identiﬁcation with France.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/banning-german-doesnt-help-either/" class="post-header">Banning German doesnt help either</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As a coda to the <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-happens-when-you-ban-headscarves/">last post</a> about banning headscarves, Vasiliki Fouka has <a href="https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/backlashjan2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another working paper</a> looking at the impact of US schools banning German as a language of instruction after World War One:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aﬀected individuals were less likely to volunteer in WWII and more likely to marry within their ethnic group and to choose decidedly German names for their oﬀspring. Rather than facilitating the assimilation of immigrant children, the <strong>policy instigated a backlash, heightening the sense of cultural identity among the minority.</strong>..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently it went further than this, with some states even banning the use of German over the telephone and some language that wouldn&#8217;t look too out of place in some contemporary discourse:</p>
<blockquote><p>A 1915 pamphlet of the American Defense League, one of the largest nationalist political groups of the time, reads as follows: “Any language which produces a people of ruthless conquistadores [sic] such as now exists in Germany, is not ﬁt to teach clean and pure American boys and girls.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the main thing is, the heightening of minority identity is similar, despite it being a completely different country and affected group:</p>
<blockquote><p>In line with the model, <strong>the backlash is greater in counties with a smaller share of German population.</strong> This is consistent with a cultural transmission mechanism in which parental and peer socialization are substitutes: In places where Germans constitute a smaller minority, parents try harder to shape each child’s sense of ethnicity because they cannot reasonably expect that children will be socialized in their ethnic culture through peer interaction alone&#8230; The extent of the backlash was higher also in counties with a greater share of Lutherans.. The implication is that <strong>communities with a greater initial sense of ethnic identity reacted more adversely to assimilation policies</strong>&#8230; The number of pupils enrolled in Sunday schools increased post-war in states that experienced a German language ban. No corresponding increase was observed in other activities of the church, such as number of schools or services held in German. This <strong>suggests that the backlash was driven by increased demand of parents for German enculturation</strong>, and not by increased supply of ethnic indoctrination by the church.</p>
