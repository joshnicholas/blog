<h1><a href="/words/private-money-for-public-goods/" class="post-header">Private money for public goods</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Almost every day for several years I would drag myself off a train at one of Sydney&#8217;s biggest train stations on the way to work.</p><br>
<p>If you&#8217;ve travelled, what&#8217;s striking about Australian train stations is how empty and tacked-on they feel. Apart from the odd shop and vending machine they are quite austere, functional and removed from the rest of life.</p><br>
<p>You don&#8217;t really get the supermarkets, vast food courts or even accomodation that are often found in Asia or Europe. Public transport hubs are places to pass through, not go to.</p><br>
<p>Australians are poorer for it.</p><br>
<p>After reading <a href="https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/download/280/201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this paper</a> about Tokyo railways I can&#8217;t help but think this is partly because Australian transport is mostly a government activity.</p><br>
<p>As government entities they are constrained in what they can do (lest they <a href="https://mumbrella.com.au/lack-of-a-level-playing-field-media-companies-submit-to-abc-and-sbs-inquiry-531039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise the ire of private competitors</a>). This not only reduces their possible services and the resulting community and consumer surplus, it leaves them open to cuts and &#8220;efficiency dividends&#8221;.</p><br>
<p>The Tokyo railways on the other hand:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;remarkably for the twenty-ﬁrst century, the private railways in Tokyo Metropolis operate at a proﬁt&#8230;</p><br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Government regulation of fares coupled with limited subsidies for railway operations pushed the private railways to innovate and <strong>diversify into a wide variety of related businesses, most notably real estate</strong>. Due to their long-term interest in the communities they built along their rail lines, the private railways provide valuable social beneﬁts through public transportation while still pursuing proﬁts.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>Unlike Australian railways, the Tokyo railways are private and profit seeking. Coupled with heavy fare regulation, we have the happy accident of their expanding into other services and amenities as a way to maximise profit.</p><br>
<p>It is arguably one of the reasons for the building density around the railway lines in Tokyo. This increases walkability and helps integrate transport networks, making it far easier to get around without a car.</p><br>
<p>You now have a virtuous cycle even as the rest of us scramble to get people out of cars.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;private railways were able to survive and thrive by branching out into businesses closely connected with the railway industry, while private operators in Europe and North America slowly began to fail due to increased competition from the automobile&#8230;. On the Toyoko line, for example, Tokyu built high rise commercial centers at Shibuya station in Tokyo at one end and Sakuragicho station in Yokohama at the other, and opened its ﬁrst department store near Shibuya in 1934. <strong>The corporation oﬀered land at low rates to universities and schools in order for them to build campuses at intermediate stations along the way.</strong></p><br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Tokyu is one of the most proﬁtable railway operators in the country, with net proﬁts of ¥58.72 billion (US$587 million, €441 million) on operating revenues of ¥263.7 billion (US$2.63 billion, €1.98 billion) in 2006 (Tokyu Corporation 2007). <strong>Real estate and transportation each bring in an equal share (33.5%) of net proﬁt</strong>, with the rest coming from retail (20.2%) and other sources.</p><br></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this could easily be an argument for complete government control. But I can&#8217;t imagine a purely government entity having the political might to get something like this done. Not without a whole lot else changing in society.</p><br>
<p>And anyway, without the ability to grow around the railway as Tokyo has done, you&#8217;re unlikely to replicate the effect. This isn&#8217;t a plan for established cities.</p><br>
<p>I guess this is more a call to be mindful of the extraordinary consumer benefit that can accrue if entrepreneurs are given the incentive to do so.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/yet-another-benefit-from-educating-girls/" class="post-header">Yet another benefit from educating girls</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>In many households, the oldest sister is one of the first family members to acquire any schooling, making her an important source of help with studies at home. Surveys show that only one out of five children who receive help with studies from a family member get it from a parent. <strong>When parents are not the ones helping with studies, the oldest sister fulfils that role 70% of the time</strong>. Given the low education of parents, and the oldest sister’s role as a childcare provider and tutor, one might expect oldest sister’s schooling to meaningfully impact younger sibling learning and development.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://voxdev.org/topic/health-education/household-benefits-educated-older-sister" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research into the benefits of educated older sisters in Pakistan</a>. Specifically in rural areas, where three quarters of mothers and two fifths of fathers were uneducated.</p><br>
<p>Javaeria Qureshi from the University of Illinois found that having an educated older sister increased a primary-aged brother&#8217;s years of schooling, ability to read and write, and add and count.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>These oldest sisters’ schooling effects are the same order of magnitude as those for maternal schooling. Interestingly, increasing the oldest sister’s schooling has no impact on older brothers’ educational outcomes, indicating that the younger brothers are not benefitting merely from being around more educated family members or because their parents are increasing investments in all of their children’s education. Instead, the <strong>results suggest that younger brothers’ education improves because they have a more educated childcare provider, tutor and role</strong> model in their oldest sister.&nbsp;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an important finding not only due to the number of children not being educated in Pakistan, but the gendered nature of education in many countries.</p><br>
<p>Women are often presumed to have a lower return on education due to a lesser propensity to work and support parents later etc. This can be especially important in resource constrained families even if there isn&#8217;t a prejudice against educating girls.</p><br>
<p>But as is so common, there&#8217;s stuff we haven&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t measure, the world is complicated and factors interrelated. Beyond the individual benefit of educating a girl, it appears to be positive sum for the family.</p><br>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Roaming packs of feral dogs now bed down at what was once Shank’s busy helicopter landing pad. Crows pick over scrap heaps amid metal tent skeletons whose torn plastic skins whip in the wind. Snow blows through collapsed walls of wood huts that once housed military offices&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Shank’s dilapidation was the result of resource limitations, claimed [Afghan Brig. Gen.] Safi, who heads a brigade in the army’s 203rd Corps. He has been fighting in Logar province for about 10 years and was posted at Shank in its prime.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Fascinating <a href="https://www.stripes.com/welcome-to-zombieland-a-former-us-army-base-rots-in-the-hands-of-overwhelmed-afghans-1.570893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article in Stars and Stripes</a> about an American camp in Afghanistan gone to ruin because the Afghan military simply doesn&#8217;t have the resources to maintain it.</p><br>
<p>But it&#8217;s also a story of the waste that accompanies the almost blank-cheque given to the American military by jingoistic politicians.</p><br>
<p>Obviously the military have different needs than domestic organisations, and we shouldn&#8217;t question that soldiers risking their lives far away from home should get some creature comforts. But could the military not look beyond their own situation, to a resource constrained future?</p><br>
<p>More importantly, does anyone believe an organisation that served the poor or disadvantaged <em>in America</em> wouldn&#8217;t be crucified for stories like this?</p><br>
<p>There&#8217;s one incredibly powerful anecdote of a tent that was heated to such a degree that US soldiers wore shorts and drank cool drinks.</p><br>
<p>Would a military with slightly less resources be able to kick any less ass? Could the money not be better used elsewhere? I hear there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water crisis in Flint</a>.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>Even with a base full of troops, Safi couldn’t afford to maintain it, he said, claiming the facilities are too costly to run. <strong>Everything the Americans left requires power, he said, even bathroom door locks his troops </strong>have replaced with ordinary padlocks.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For just one of the big tents now rotting in Zombieland, the Americans would burn about 80 gallons of fuel a night, said Safi, who spent hours one January morning searching room to room in his headquarters for a working heater.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Where are Afghans supposed to get that much fuel?” Safi asked. He said later: <strong>“The Americans, money has no value for them.”</strong></p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/we-need-more-technological-bilingualism/" class="post-header">We need more technological ’bilingualism’</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Something that bugs me is the widespread, continued segregation of technology. Technology might be something you use, but rarely is it something you make or even understand.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m currently thinking of all the people who I WhatsApp whose eyes gloss over at the mention of encryption.</p><br>
<p>This is often reflected in organisations, with technology teams separate from the rest of us. There are obviously some exceptions. Notably companies where the product <em>is</em> technology. But more often there is little overlap between those that make the product (etc.) and the nerds who make it possible.</p><br>
<p>The overlap often takes the shape of particular individual(s). But we all have to become the nerds who make it all possible.</p><br>
<p>Technology is no longer something separate from the rest of our lives. If it ever was.</p><br>
<p>In newsrooms, the tech nerds are often off somewhere leaving the overlap to take the form of data or multimedia journalists. This isn&#8217;t enough. There are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/at_one_virginia_paper_coders_and_journalists_unite_to_make_sense_of_gov_and_data.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many important stories</a>, too much to <a href="http://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/03/04/for-fucks-fake.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miss</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612974/once-hailed-as-unhackable-blockchains-are-now-getting-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misunderstand</a> or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608248/biased-algorithms-are-everywhere-and-no-one-seems-to-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underestimate;</a>&nbsp;not to mention too many <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity enhancements</a>, for computers to just be a blunt instrument.</p><br>
<p>Anyway, all of this came to mind as I was reading an <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613063/ai-ethics-mit-college-of-computing-tech-humanities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Tech Review article</a> about the launch of a new multi-disciplinary college at the University:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>“The world needs bilinguals,” said MIT president Rafael Reif. In other words, the <strong>world needs engineers with a better grounding in the liberal arts</strong>, who can build more ethical products and platforms, as well as <strong>policymakers and civic leaders with a better understanding of technology</strong> to help guide responsible innovation&#8230;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Faculty at the new college will work with other MIT departments to cross-pollinate ideas. Classes will also be designed so that technical skills, social sciences, and the humanities are bound up together within each course rather than learned separately.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. But I&#8217;m not sure the solution lies in more cross-disciplinary study (although it is definitely necessary) as much as it does in employers etc. valuing people who aren&#8217;t cookie-cut candidates, who have more diverse or even tangential experience.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to do that.</p><br>
