<h1><a href="/words/technologys-language-bias/" class="post-header">Technology‚Äôs language bias</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the many underlying tensions in Sri Lanka is that between people fluent in English and those who aren‚Äôt. After independence and Sinhala made the country‚Äôs official language, <a href="http://www.ft.lk/columns/Sinhala-education-has-led-to-downfall-of-Sinhalese-and-country/4-660486">education was converted</a> to ‚ÄúSwabasha‚Äù.</p>
<p>But the elite kept English. It is the medium in most private and international schools. University courses are mostly in English, as are the offices of big corporations. There is a huge wage premium in an English education.</p>
<p>All of which have resulted in an inevitable pushback.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/im-a-victim-of-sinhala-medium-education/amp/">debate</a> over English education has been a backdrop to my last couple of months, as I‚Äôve been learning to code and scraping the web.</p>
<p>Just the other day I was scraping the Sri Lankan parliament website, and commenting to my grandpa how the HTML is all in English. But how can this be?</p>
<p>This is the central point of a great <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/coding-is-for-everyoneas-long-as-you-speak-english/">Wired article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In theory, you can make a programming language out of any symbols. The computer doesn&#8217;t care. The computer is already running an invisible program (a compiler) to translate your IF orinto the 1s and 0s that it functions in, and it would function just as effectively if we used a potato emoji ü•î to stand for IF and the obscure 15th century Cyrillic symbol multiocular O ÍôÆ to stand for. <strong>The fact that programming languages often resemble English words like body or if is a convenient accommodation for our puny human meatbrains</strong>, which are much better at remembering commands that look like words we already know.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But only some of us already know the words of these commands: those of us who speak English. <strong>The &#8220;initial promise of the web&#8221; was only ever a promise to its English-speaking users</strong>, whether native English-speaking or with access to the kind of elite education that produces fluent second-language English speakers in non-English-dominant areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of multilingual programming languages, and programming languages based on other natural languages, but they‚Äôre nowhere near as supported or extended.</p>
<p>Without a large community of fellow travellers there aren‚Äôt big archives of questions and answers to query when you yourself have a problem, or huge repositories of packages and modules to extend your code.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve recently been studying natural language processing, which is another domain with a huge bias towards English. The letters and symbols of many languages aren‚Äôt even supported by Unicode.</p>
<p>The Wired article ends with a hopeful message that we might eventually have ‚ÄúSwahili HTML‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussian HTML‚Äù in addition to ‚ÄúEnglish HTML‚Äù (rather than HTML being synonymous with English). The author notes that people learn coding better in their native tongues, and that European writing was once synonymous with Latin before branching into many vernaculars.</p>
<p>But there needs to be a blend of these answers. There likely won‚Äôt be any one small natural language-based computer language that can compete with a large one for usability and flexibility. But that doesn‚Äôt mean localised computer languages can‚Äôt be powerful, useful or a great pathway.</p>
<p>Until then a lot of the power of modern technologies will remain the privilege of those with English language skills.</p>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>In America, women were not only ideal tea room consumers, <strong>nearly all tea rooms were owned by women</strong>. It started small, with mostly middle class women opening up a room in their home or setting up tables in their garden and offering tea and light meals. This phenomenon wasn‚Äôt unique to the U.S.: British women served scones, cakes, and tea as a way to make extra money, too. Unlike many occupations, feeding people and presiding as hostesses were accepted ways for women to enter the workforce, since these tasks felt a lot like what they‚Äôd been doing all along, without pay.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/show-me-the-receipts/" class="post-header">Show me the receipts</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A consequence of the last decade-plus of mindless, saturation media is an endless parade of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and ‚Äúpundits‚Äù who have little at stake and pay no price for mistakes.</p>
<p>The very loud people who oppose action on climate change, for instance. Even business lobbies are often add odds with businesses, many of which <a href="https://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/the-shadow-carbon-price-companies-are-already-paying-20190424-p51gyc">are already planning for a changed climate</a>.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/market-betting-climate-change">brilliant article on VoxEu</a> about the people who do have money on the line:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our recent paper (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25554">Schlenker and Taylor 2019</a>), we look at weather derivatives in financial markets to assess beliefs about climate. <strong>We find that traders have been pricing in a warming trend that is closely aligned with the projections of scientific climate models</strong>, as well as the observed weather outcomes during that time&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;Futures prices closely follow the predictions of climate scientists</strong>, which, on average, appear to have materialised, thus validating the climate models. This close agreement between markets and models implies that traders are taking into consideration the scientific consensus on climate change when making trades. Overall, we find that the market has been accurately pricing in climate change, largely in line with global climate models, and that <strong>this began occurring at least since the early 2000s</strong> when the weather futures markets were formed.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of liquid markets where someone with a contrarian take on climate change or the housing market (etc.) could make a lot of money.</p>
<p>It isn‚Äôt enough that you were ‚Äúright last time‚Äù. That could have been a fluke. That might have been one correct prediction after many wrong ones.</p>
<p>In the real world that batting average doesn‚Äôt work. So, journalists should ask for receipts.</p>
<p>If an expert or pundit makes a bold claim they need to put their money where their mouth is. Otherwise it‚Äôs just hot air.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/what-causes-crime/" class="post-header">What causes crime?</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>There is something we find uncomfortable about a world without obvious answers, which is one reason, of course, why we cling stubbornly to our dominant views of crime. Our thirst for certainty may also explain why a <strong>number of theories about crime have, when stated boldly, gained alarming and unjustified popularity</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/criminal-the-truth-about-why-people-do-bad-things/oclc/976424912&amp;referer=brief_results">Criminal</a> by Tom Gash falls right into the <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/there-probably-isnt-one-reason/">recent theme</a> on this blog.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve just started this book, and I‚Äôm not entirely sold on its premise yet. But it does a good job of framing how public policy and discussion can be captured by a false dichotomy. And seemingly because the simple narratives fill a painful void &#8211; we don‚Äôt know why people commit crimes and it‚Äôs probably too complex to ever submit to an single, easily expressed answer.</p>
<p>Gash essentially argues there are currently two dominant explanations for ‚Äúwhy‚Äù someone commits a crime:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first I call the ‚ÄòHeroes and Villains‚Äô view, because of its moral emphasis and its central premise that those who commit crime must be confronted by the full force of the justice system to avoid society becoming corrupted. The second I call the ‚ÄòVictims and Survivors‚Äô view, reflecting the argument that crime is not simply a selfish choice but often one forced by adverse circumstances&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This dichotomy between evildoers and victims of circumstance is quite evident in the world around us. Take the war on drugs and it‚Äôs more recent backlash, which has so often been a proxy for deterrence.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve myself strongly argued against deterrence, leaning heavily into arguments about social context, learned norms and identities, and, ultimately, path dependence.</p>
<p>But this is really too simple.</p>
<blockquote><p>Think of the last time you committed a crime (contrary to our Heroes and Villains view, most of us have) ‚Äì or, if you are in the minority, think of a recent case you know of. Then consider the forces at work affecting your behaviour. I am certain that you will most likely <b>uncover layer upon layer of possible influences</b>, many considerations interacting in complex ways to facilitate the crime in question.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Gash notes, ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù is too blunt a tool for what we are trying to accomplish. In fact, crime appears to be highly specific and contextual, and we‚Äôre ignoring profound economic, social and technological shifts.</p>
<p>There probably is neither one reason or one answer.</p>
<p><em>As always my emphasis</em></p>
