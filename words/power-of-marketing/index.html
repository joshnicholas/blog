<blockquote>The detox phenomenon is interesting because it represents one of the most grandiose innovations of marketers, lifestyle gurus, and alternative therapists: the invention of a whole new physiological process. In terms of basic human biochemistry, detox is a meaningless concept. It doesn’t cleave nature at the joints. There is nothing on the ‘detox system’ in a medical textbook. That burgers and beer can have negative effects on your body is certainly true, for a number of reasons; but the notion that they leave a specific residue, which can be extruded by a specific process, a physiological system called detox, is a marketing invention.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/science/oclc/718339454&amp;referer=brief_results">Bad Science</a>. That marketing shapes our world and created affairs, like Mother's Day, isn't new. But something feels a bit different about "toxins".</p><p>It isn't just a bit of mindless consumerism. It goes beyond that. It plays on fears and disconnection. And it has profound impact on many. People have changed entire lifestyles to escape toxins.</p>
