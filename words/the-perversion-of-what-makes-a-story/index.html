<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There’s a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/Causes-of-death-vs-media-coverage.png">graph</a> doing the rounds that spectacularly illutrates <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/the-spectacular-bias/">how context rules coverage</a>. Taken from Our World in Data, it compares actual causes of death to Google searches and media coverage.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from">accompanying blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;around one-third of the considered causes of deaths resulted from heart disease, yet this cause of death receives only 2-3 percent of Google searches and media coverage&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;When it comes to the media coverage on causes of death, <strong>violent deaths account for more than two-thirds of coverage</strong> in the New York Times and The Guardian but <strong>account for less than 3 percent of the total deaths</strong> in the US&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(My emphasis)</em></p>
<p>The stories we tell shape our reality, our concerns and actions. This places a lot of power in who and what determines a story, especially the ideological, financial and technological (etc.) incentives and constraints.</p>
<p>All of the journalists I’ve ever met have been hyper-concerned with being accurate. But this seems to relate more to the “facts” within the story, rather than the choice of what to cover.</p>
<p>Over-inflating the salience of a violent death is surely as misleading?</p>
