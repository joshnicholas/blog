<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>People who excel at programming, notes the coder and tech-culture critic Maciej Cegłowski, often “become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. <strong>Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.</strong>”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/coders-how-software-programmers-think-and-how-their-thinking-is-changing-our-world/oclc/1078434444&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coders</a>, a book I only just downloaded but am absolutely tearing through.</p><br>
<p>The subtitle is &#8220;how software programmers think, and how their thinking is changing our world&#8221;, which is a clue to what Ceglowski is referring to.</p><br>
<p>When you&#8217;re writing code you&#8217;re trying to break a process down, to first principles and then into easy steps as you go along.</p><br>
<p>You build it back up in an environment over which you have a huge amount of control, that thrives on trial, error and iteration.</p><br>
<p>Where something usually either works or breaks obviously. Everything is very structured and built upon logic.</p><br>
<p>But by this point you&#8217;ve also abstracted so much you can trick yourself into thinking you&#8217;ve mastered all the nuances, not just how to get from A to B.</p><br>
<p>It&#8217;s also an alluring way of thinking, which you begin applying to other problems in your life. In a similar way to how you can start thinking in another language if you are sufficiently steeped in it.</p><br>
<p>This is a fantastic book so far. Hope to post some more.</p><br>
<p><em>As always my emphasis.</em></p><br>
