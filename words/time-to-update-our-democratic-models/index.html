<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>Throughout childhood and until late adolescence, our brains are building their internal models of what is out there and how it all works –physical, social, emotional and so on. After that, <strong>our core beliefs harden and we find change</strong>, according to Professor of Psychiatry Bruce Wexler, <strong>‘difficult and painful’.</strong> The <strong>power of our many cognitive biases skews our view. We attack unwelcome information</strong>. The gravity of our personal worlds attracts us to other, similar worlds –people who ‘see it like we do’, whose opinions give us the warm, reassuring pleasure of comfort, familiarity, safety. <strong>It all thickens the illusion that our way is the trueway.</strong></p><br>

<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/heretics-adventures-with-the-enemies-of-science/oclc/815365740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Heretics</a> by Will Storr. It&#8217;s part investigation, part memoir, as Storr embeds with homeopaths, faith healers, neo nazis and others with &#8220;weird beliefs&#8221;.</p><br>
<p>I&#8217;m slowly going through my notes and may pull out some more, but the thing that consistently struck me throughout is what this means for institutional design.</p><br>
<p>Our democracies absolutely were not built, and have not evolved, with our more sophisticated understanding of how people build beliefs and make decisions. How fallible our memories are, how we capitulate to group think, react and then build post hoc justifications (etc.).</p><br>
<p>Meanwhile those who wish to take advantage of us certainly have.</p><br>
<blockquote><p>In that strange, chemical and alchemical moment when an unconscious decision is made about what to believe, how much is genetic, how much is rational, how much is concerned solely with reinforcing our dearly held models of the world? And how does personality collide with all of this? How does the character of the decider – all that complex emotionality, the calculation of possible outcomes, the current state of mind, the kaleidoscope of motives, the autobiographical heromission – pollute the process? With these questions, we have struck rock. There is no answer.</p><br>
