<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>The people who have always been able to do something about this — the ones building the software — have always known when their software was doing something wrong. It&#8217;s their <em>job</em> to find bugs, and if they&#8217;re worth their salt, they&#8217;re always looking for flaws in the overall design, as well as the functional components of what they&#8217;re building. They know that violating user privacy without consent is a bug. <strong>Operating in a way inconsistent with the user&#8217;s expectations is a bug. Coercing people into using your product with psychological tricks is a bug.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Though many of these poor designs are instigated by higher-ups, they are ultimately implemented by professionals with a deep knowledge of their field. <strong>Designers know when they&#8217;re mocking up screens that prey on people&#8217;s most basic desires; developers know when they&#8217;re implementing designs that would feel incredibly wrong as the end user</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from an <a href="https://write.as/matt/how-to-actually-fix-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old article by Matt Baer</a>, and is talking about problematic business models in general on the internet.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t about Facebook or any specific scandal.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s an interesting thought. It isn&#8217;t just Zuckerberg or Kalanick or [pick your leader of scandal generating tech company].</p>
<p>The people that write the code and design the interfaces know what they&#8217;re doing. Perhaps we should hold them as morally responsible as we do financiers?</p>

<h1><a href="/words/our-climate-future-lies-in-the-past/" class="post-header">Our climate future lies in the past</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shambolic state of climate change discourse in Australia (and elsewhere) has left us largely focusing on electricity suppliers and technological solutionism.</p>
<p>But as American economist John Cochrane <a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2019/01/economists-letter-on-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out,</a> the answer probably lies less in contraptions and arbitrary interventions than old ways of living:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="caret-color: rgb(51, 51, 51); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family" blanco osf georgia sans-serif font-size: font-style: normal font-variant-caps: font-weight: letter-spacing: orphans: auto text-align: left text-indent: text-transform: none white-space: widows: word-spacing: rgba background-color: rgb text-decoration: display: inline float:>&#8230;a carbon tax is the only way to change behavior.</span><strong> The answer to energy savings isn&#8217;t as much new technology as in old behaviors.</strong> Turn the lights off. Take fewer trips. Turn the heat down. Move nearer your work. Carpool. Without a carbon tax there is no way for the average bleeding heart Palo Alto climate worrier to realize that one trip to Europe is like driving a car for 10,000 miles. (Planes get about 80 passenger miles per gallon &#8212; but it&#8217;s a lot of miles to Europe.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to incentivise these behavioural changes we need to make the cost of carbon emissions more salient.</p>
<p>Granted, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-our-carbon-emission-policies-dont-work-on-air-travel-99019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won&#8217;t work in every sector</a> thanks to varying elasticities of demand. But it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think the proceeds should be <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/Australian%20Carbon%20Dividend%20Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">given straight back as a dividend</a> (or some other mechanism to ameliorate compounded inequality), it&#8217;s [past] time to tax carbon.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/" class="post-header">Its about who you know and trust</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>There is a pervasive idea in Western culture that humans are essentially rational, deftly sorting fact from fiction, and, ultimately, arriving at timeless truths about the world. This line of thinking holds that humans follow the rules of logic, calculate probabilities accurately, and make decisions about the world that are perfectly informed by all available information. Conversely, <strong>failures to make effective and well-informed decisions are often chalked up to failures of human reasoning</strong>—resulting, say, from psychological tics or cognitive biases&#8230; Models of social learning help us see that this picture of human learning and rationality is dangerously distorted. What we see in these models is that <strong>even perfectly rational—albeit simple—agents who learn from others in their social network can fail to form true beliefs about the world</strong>, even when more than adequate evidence is available. In other words, individually rational agents can form groups that are not rational at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/misinformation-age-how-false-beliefs-spread/oclc/1084360985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Misinformation Age</a> by Cailin O&#8217;Connor and James Owen Weatherall, which I first referenced <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/everyone-wants-to-be-the-hero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a couple of days ago</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance that <em>your beliefs are a product of the people you surround yourself with </em>is quite banal. Of course most us haven&#8217;t personally verified even a fraction of our &#8220;knowledge&#8221; &#8211; from the mathematical heuristics we learn in school to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/five-maps-that-will-change-how-you-see-the-world-74967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual size of Greenland</a>.</p>
<p>In fact the ability to share information &#8211; both bad and good &#8211; is a major factor in our success as a species.</p>
<p>But unpack this a little more &#8211; as the authors of this book do masterfully &#8211; and it starts to dawn how devastating poor information hygiene really is. Your personal store of knowledge or model of the world isn&#8217;t so much the product of your own &#8220;filter&#8221;, but the filter of those around you. And around them. And around them&#8230;.</p>
<p>And, as the models that O&#8217;Connor and Weatherall construct show, it isn&#8217;t just deliberate misinformation that can affect those in a social network. In fact, misinformation is only one way companies etc. can  <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas/status/1097092891434901504?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subtly put their finger on the scale</a>.</p>
<p>Rather, both deliberate and unconscious misunderstanding of uncertainty and randomness can filter through to the unwitting, not least by curtailing the possible or sending us down wrong tracks. And this is before adding the complexities of conformity bias, clustering and selection, distrust etc.</p>
<p>So, what to do? I don&#8217;t know. But consider this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we need to understand the social character of belief—and recognize that <strong>widespread falsehood is a necessary</strong>, but harmful, corollary to our most powerful tools for learning truths&#8230; When we open channels for social communication, we immediately face a trade-off. <strong>If we want to have as many true beliefs as possible, we should trust everything we hear</strong>. This way, every true belief passing through our social network also becomes part of our belief system. And <strong>if we want to minimize the number of false beliefs we have, we should not believe anything</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="/words/lets-stop-poisoning-ourselves/" class="post-header">Let’s stop poisoning ourselves</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horrifying working paper</a> looks at the impact of traffic pollution on students in schools downwind of a major US highway:</p>
<blockquote><p>We find that attending school where prevailing winds place it downwind of a nearby highway more than 60% of the time is associated with <strong>0.040 of a standard deviation lower test scores, a 4.1 percentage point increase in behavioral incidents, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in the rate of absences over the school year</strong>, compared to attending a school upwind of a highway the same distance away</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.4 million American children attend a school within 250m of a highway, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Children may be particularly susceptible to the carbon monoxide etc. that comes out of exhaust pipes, but really any of us who work or live near traffic should be worried.</p>
<p>If climate change is too abstract, far away or big for us to tackle, this shouldn&#8217;t be. The cost-benefit of transport (for starters) is clear and present. At the very least we all need to drive less.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re not just talking about immediate impacts &#8211; think of how some of these issues (lower test scores, poor behaviour etc.) compound, as people get labelled troublesome or miss opportunities.</p>
<p>Air pollution, in other words, feeds inequality.</p>
<p>Other papers cited in this study illustrate the breadth of the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Currie and colleagues found that high levels of carbon monoxide were associated with reduced school attendance&#8230; Ransom and Pope (1992) similarly found a relationship between pollution and school attendance, with more small particulate matter in the air associated with more absences&#8230; Chang et al. (2016a, 2016b) use hourly variation to show that increased exposure to fine particulate matter decreases productivity per hour of pear packers and call center workers, while Archsmith, Heyes, and Saberian (2018) showed that baseball umpires make more mistakes on days with higher pollution&#8230;Herrnstadt and Muehlegger (2015) argue that traffic pollution influences impulse control. They showed that short-term hourly variation in wind direction in Chicago lead to higher crime in areas downwind of highways than on the opposite upwind side&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, as an addendum to <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-are-school-tests-trying-to-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my last post</a> about randomness and test scores:</p>
<blockquote><p>Marcotte (2017) used the variation in air quality on different testing days and found that children who <strong>took tests on worse days for pollen and fine airborne particulate matter had worse outcomes</strong>.</p>
