<h1><a href="/words/banning-german-doesnt-help-either/" class="post-header">Banning German doesnt help either</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As a coda to the <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/what-happens-when-you-ban-headscarves/">last post</a> about banning headscarves, Vasiliki Fouka has <a href="https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/backlashjan2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another working paper</a> looking at the impact of US schools banning German as a language of instruction after World War One:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aﬀected individuals were less likely to volunteer in WWII and more likely to marry within their ethnic group and to choose decidedly German names for their oﬀspring. Rather than facilitating the assimilation of immigrant children, the <strong>policy instigated a backlash, heightening the sense of cultural identity among the minority.</strong>..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently it went further than this, with some states even banning the use of German over the telephone and some language that wouldn&#8217;t look too out of place in some contemporary discourse:</p>
<blockquote><p>A 1915 pamphlet of the American Defense League, one of the largest nationalist political groups of the time, reads as follows: “Any language which produces a people of ruthless conquistadores [sic] such as now exists in Germany, is not ﬁt to teach clean and pure American boys and girls.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the main thing is, the heightening of minority identity is similar, despite it being a completely different country and affected group:</p>
<blockquote><p>In line with the model, <strong>the backlash is greater in counties with a smaller share of German population.</strong> This is consistent with a cultural transmission mechanism in which parental and peer socialization are substitutes: In places where Germans constitute a smaller minority, parents try harder to shape each child’s sense of ethnicity because they cannot reasonably expect that children will be socialized in their ethnic culture through peer interaction alone&#8230; The extent of the backlash was higher also in counties with a greater share of Lutherans.. The implication is that <strong>communities with a greater initial sense of ethnic identity reacted more adversely to assimilation policies</strong>&#8230; The number of pupils enrolled in Sunday schools increased post-war in states that experienced a German language ban. No corresponding increase was observed in other activities of the church, such as number of schools or services held in German. This <strong>suggests that the backlash was driven by increased demand of parents for German enculturation</strong>, and not by increased supply of ethnic indoctrination by the church.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/our-climate-future-lies-in-the-past/" class="post-header">Our climate future lies in the past</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shambolic state of climate change discourse in Australia (and elsewhere) has left us largely focusing on electricity suppliers and technological solutionism.</p>
<p>But as American economist John Cochrane <a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2019/01/economists-letter-on-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out,</a> the answer probably lies less in contraptions and arbitrary interventions than old ways of living:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="caret-color: rgb(51, 51, 51); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family" blanco osf georgia sans-serif font-size: font-style: normal font-variant-caps: font-weight: letter-spacing: orphans: auto text-align: left text-indent: text-transform: none white-space: widows: word-spacing: rgba background-color: rgb text-decoration: display: inline float:>&#8230;a carbon tax is the only way to change behavior.</span><strong> The answer to energy savings isn&#8217;t as much new technology as in old behaviors.</strong> Turn the lights off. Take fewer trips. Turn the heat down. Move nearer your work. Carpool. Without a carbon tax there is no way for the average bleeding heart Palo Alto climate worrier to realize that one trip to Europe is like driving a car for 10,000 miles. (Planes get about 80 passenger miles per gallon &#8212; but it&#8217;s a lot of miles to Europe.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to incentivise these behavioural changes we need to make the cost of carbon emissions more salient.</p>
<p>Granted, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-our-carbon-emission-policies-dont-work-on-air-travel-99019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won&#8217;t work in every sector</a> thanks to varying elasticities of demand. But it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think the proceeds should be <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/Australian%20Carbon%20Dividend%20Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">given straight back as a dividend</a> (or some other mechanism to ameliorate compounded inequality), it&#8217;s [past] time to tax carbon.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/its-about-who-you-know-and-trust/" class="post-header">Its about who you know and trust</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>There is a pervasive idea in Western culture that humans are essentially rational, deftly sorting fact from fiction, and, ultimately, arriving at timeless truths about the world. This line of thinking holds that humans follow the rules of logic, calculate probabilities accurately, and make decisions about the world that are perfectly informed by all available information. Conversely, <strong>failures to make effective and well-informed decisions are often chalked up to failures of human reasoning</strong>—resulting, say, from psychological tics or cognitive biases&#8230; Models of social learning help us see that this picture of human learning and rationality is dangerously distorted. What we see in these models is that <strong>even perfectly rational—albeit simple—agents who learn from others in their social network can fail to form true beliefs about the world</strong>, even when more than adequate evidence is available. In other words, individually rational agents can form groups that are not rational at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/misinformation-age-how-false-beliefs-spread/oclc/1084360985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Misinformation Age</a> by Cailin O&#8217;Connor and James Owen Weatherall, which I first referenced <a href="https://joshnicholas.com/everyone-wants-to-be-the-hero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a couple of days ago</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance that <em>your beliefs are a product of the people you surround yourself with </em>is quite banal. Of course most us haven&#8217;t personally verified even a fraction of our &#8220;knowledge&#8221; &#8211; from the mathematical heuristics we learn in school to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/five-maps-that-will-change-how-you-see-the-world-74967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual size of Greenland</a>.</p>
<p>In fact the ability to share information &#8211; both bad and good &#8211; is a major factor in our success as a species.</p>
<p>But unpack this a little more &#8211; as the authors of this book do masterfully &#8211; and it starts to dawn how devastating poor information hygiene really is. Your personal store of knowledge or model of the world isn&#8217;t so much the product of your own &#8220;filter&#8221;, but the filter of those around you. And around them. And around them&#8230;.</p>
<p>And, as the models that O&#8217;Connor and Weatherall construct show, it isn&#8217;t just deliberate misinformation that can affect those in a social network. In fact, misinformation is only one way companies etc. can  <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcnicholas/status/1097092891434901504?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subtly put their finger on the scale</a>.</p>
<p>Rather, both deliberate and unconscious misunderstanding of uncertainty and randomness can filter through to the unwitting, not least by curtailing the possible or sending us down wrong tracks. And this is before adding the complexities of conformity bias, clustering and selection, distrust etc.</p>
<p>So, what to do? I don&#8217;t know. But consider this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we need to understand the social character of belief—and recognize that <strong>widespread falsehood is a necessary</strong>, but harmful, corollary to our most powerful tools for learning truths&#8230; When we open channels for social communication, we immediately face a trade-off. <strong>If we want to have as many true beliefs as possible, we should trust everything we hear</strong>. This way, every true belief passing through our social network also becomes part of our belief system. And <strong>if we want to minimize the number of false beliefs we have, we should not believe anything</strong>.</p></blockquote>
