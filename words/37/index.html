<h1><a href="/words/we-need-to-position-ourselves-for-the-comparative-advantages-of-the-future/" class="post-header">We need to position ourselves for the comparative advantages of the future</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve finally finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111341-the-industries-of-the-future?from_search=true">The Industries of The Future</a> by Alec Ross. As the name suggests it is a thorough look at what lies ahead, from the point of view of the former Senior Adviser for Innovation to Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. Taking care to constantly root his observations in humanity, Ross rapidly sweeps through the roles that will be played by robotics, code, data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and much more. By grounding his observations in humanity I am referring to repeated references to history, perception and anecdote.</p><br>
<p>An unfortunate many of these kinds of books end up defeated by their own techno-utopianism. Written by participants or long-time watchers, many fail to grasp the effects so much of this change will have on those currently out of the loop – without capital, connections, requisite knowledge, who live in the periphery, or are the wrong gender or race. Ross takes a global view here, and his coverage of advances in Africa, especially, was better than I had seen before. He has a remarkable point of view – growing up the child of immigrants and relatively poor, but most recently coming in contact with many leaders of countries, companies and academia. The diversity of coverage and emphasis is not perfect, obviously, but better than I’ve seen.</p><br>
<p>I’ve already touched on a lot of this book, but I want to talk a little bit about Estonia, which features prominently in the final chapters. Estonia, a country of just over a million people, has a government determined to be at the forefront of the many changes Ross notes. With such a small population, and unable to put up barriers due to its membership of the Eurozone, this makes sense. But even more, Estonia has embraced the mindset of technology. It enshrined internet access as a human right in 2000, started teaching coding in the first grade, created an “e-residency” program to become a gateway to business services, and has rapidly moved to put as many government services online as it can.</p><br>
<p>In other words, Estonia has recognised that technology will mean ever more competition. And the only way to survive an increasingly winner-take-all world, is to equip yourselves and become a first mover. Even better, technology is levelling the playing field in many areas. As these quotes attest:</p><br>
<blockquote><p>
“[Estonian President Toomas Hendrik] Ilves thinks that the advancement of robotics serves Estonia well by giving the small countries of the world the chance to compete on the global stage with actors like China and India. He told me <em>‘It will increase our functional size tremendously because people don’t have to do things the machines can do.’</em> Estonia has only 1.3 million citizens.”
</p><br></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
“How does a little country like Estonia compete in the same global marketplace as China, which has a labor force a little more than 1,000 times the size of its own? It takes advantage of the fact that robots enable a relatively small workforce to produce higher levels of output than would be the case in an all-human workforce. Estonia and China will never be equal competitors by sole virtue of their difference in size, but Estonia can compete at a level far above what its size would suggest by virtue of being cutting-edge in the field of robotics as both producer and consumer.”
</p><br></blockquote>
<p>Fears of losing legacy businesses and mass structural unemployment have caused many countries to pause for too long, and even <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/how-much-more-would-we-have-benefited-from-laws-that-kept-up/">try to fend off progress</a>. But the world is being upended, and as President Ilves points out, our conceptions of what makes a comparative advantage are going to change dramatically, and very soon.</p><br>
<p>Will the raw materials of the information age be base metals? How can large populations continue to provide an economic boon as cheap manufacturing is done by robots, while social welfare systems remain? Do roads matter as much as internet access as location becomes less important? What gives a nation advantage in the future is likely to be very different from what we’ve seen before. We need to position ourselves to take advantage of them.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/daniel-flynn/" class="post-header">Success comes from being creative and overcoming constraints</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are a lot of little lessons in Chapter One, a book about the founding of <a href="https://thankyou.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thankyou</a> by Daniel Flynn. After all, it’s the story of three twenty-year olds with little experience in business or philanthropy, creating one of Australia’s most successful social enterprises &#8211; selling water, food and hygiene products to fund projects in developing countries. The ups and downs are half the fun.</p><br>
<p>But my favourite section comes right at the end, as Flynn reflects on this, the first chapter of his story.</p><br>
<blockquote><p><em>“with less financial restrictions comes the temptation to pump money into things simply because you’ve got the budget for it. In doing so, you run the very high risk of spending on something that’s an average idea.”</em></p><br></blockquote>
<p>A running theme throughout Flynn’s story are the odds in the way &#8211; his organisation, often buoyed only by belief and passionate supporters, facing off against entrenched interests and disbelieving middlemen. The story of Thankyou becomes the story of finding workarounds, of skipping the first step and coming back to it later.</p><br>
<p>As someone who writes a lot about startups, steeped in press releases about seed funding and the necessity of more capital, this is refreshing. Thankyou is a brand selling physical products, unlike someone purveying digital goods, the barriers to entry for Thankyou have been very high, but they always found a way. Thankyou was constantly validating, having to prove themselves. They are a far better organisation for it.</p><br>
<p>It also makes me think of older aid organisations, how mountains of cash and a place in the establishment can slowly rot away an institution with even the best of intentions. Incentives become misaligned, becoming more about perpetuation than the original goal. Cash is so bountiful that strategy and an emphasis on ROI melts away. Just think of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Publica’s stunning 2015 investigation into the Red Cross</a> &#8211; how they raised half a billion dollars to build just six homes in Haiti.</p><br>
<p>Anyway, back to Flynn, and he comes up with a great image for the Thankyou method of getting started: letting the cart pull the horse. In this case, referring to the first ever product they launched, where they received an order for 50,000 bottles of water, and a donation of 30,000 bottles, before they had even setup the business or really sorted out a supplier. They then had to go find some money to make it all work. It might not have ever happened had they tried to do it the conventional way &#8211; have a great idea and go find someone to fund it.</p><br>
<blockquote><p><em>“An example of the horse pulling the car would be: find your $20,000 start-up capital, then register the business, and then try and get a distribution deal. But the cart pulling the horse scenario is: land the 50,000 bottle order, then figure out a way to find the $20,000 you need to register and set up the business.”</em></p><br></blockquote>
<p>Thankyou are currently selling Chapter One with a &#8216;pay what you want&#8217; model<a href="https://chapterone.thankyou.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> on their website</a>. Another example of constraints leading to creativity &#8211; they are raising money to fund an expansion into New Zealand.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/the-story-behind-piracy-is-more-complicated-than-you-think/" class="post-header">The story behind piracy is more complicated than you think</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>How did we get to a point where piracy is the default? What drives the millions who consume without paying, without even considering it? How did their tools and methodologies come into being? The answers are varied, often simplistic, largely informed by ideology, experience and financial status.</p><br>
<p>The most important learning from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525426612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0525426612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20&amp;linkId=XXFHJTNGAUQ2QM5W">How Music Got Free by Stephen Witt</a> is that the reality is complex. The tools of the piracy trade were created and diffused for commercial reasons. The very weapons that threaten intellectual property were created because of its incentives. The music industry, like so many that have been thoroughly disrupted, was more focused on protecting its turf than serving customers.</p><br>
<p>The story of recent music piracy is largely that of the mp3. Much of Witt’s book is a sweeping explanation, from its troublesome birth to its role as a technological enabler – its compression making internet distribution possible, its adoption begetting the vicious circle of iPods, ripping, sharing and networks. One of the biggest names in pirate history – Napster, makes an appearance only briefly, 114 pages into the book.</p><br>
<p>Until then we are treated to the story of the mp3’s inventors, a team of German engineers, and its investors, the German government and a few corporations. They weren’t trying to create a tool for piracy. Rather, they were trying to fix a very real problem with audio compression. To that end they created a new audio standard, one adopted for countless legitimate uses. But it was also adopted by the pirates – mp3’s allowed for music files a twelfth the size of what had come before, which was essential in a world of dial-up.</p><br>
<p>This is the hilarious contradiction at the heart of Witt’s history of music piracy; the technology that has arguably done most to make it possible – the mp3, was only created because of the promise of the monopoly rents afforded by intellectual property rights. While the mp3 helped bypass the copyright of musicians and labels, bringing an industry to its knees, its creators walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><br>
<p>It also doesn’t seem like the actual pirates made much either. Sure, Witt tells the stories of a pirate here, and a syndicate there, who were doing so commercially. But as with many such syndicates on the internet, the driving forces seem to be community, discovery, and the breaking down of technical barriers. Napster wasn’t intended to be commercial, having a weird business model bolted onto it halfway through. Neither were Oink, the Pirate Bay or BitTorrent.</p><br>
<p>Its where all these pieces fit together that I think the most important point is made – technology, consumers and pirates were all coming together to make a better experience that the industry wanted nothing to do with. The industry wanted to remain in a world of scarcity, forcing users to buy bundles. As the internet began to offer an unlimited selection of music, on demand, the industry dragged its feet and refused to offer a comparable product – the mp3 inventors had pitched a streaming service but were knocked back, Steve Jobs had to fight for the iTunes store.</p><br>
<p>Yet the consumers obviously demanded such a service. Torrent networks have created networks of millions, braving the unknown to listen to what they want when they want. Piracy cut across age groups and demographics, something made evident by the wide variety of people prosecuted by the industry as they sought to protect the old business rather than embrace a new one. It was only after being resoundingly beaten that the industry moved, offering its consumers a comparable experience that they could pay for – Vimeo, Spotify, the iTunes store. And pay for it they have.</p><br>
<p>I come to this topic, obviously, from a position of sympathy for piracy. When my friends and I were younger – far from being adults, we participated. While our pocket money would only stretch so far for movies and music, I don’t believe this was what drove us. It was selection. Buying a whole album for the the two songs we wanted is ridiculous. Especially with an iPod to fill. And as time has passed, the reduction in piracy has mirrored the availability of media. Why would anyone bother to brave the wild west of torrenting when Spotify, Youtube, Netflix and numerous other services offer such variety and quality at such low prices? There just isn’t any need to do it anymore. If only the music industry had gotten on board sooner.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/fish-that-ate-the-whale/" class="post-header">The Fish that Ate the Whale</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p></a>Have you ever read a biography of someone you have never heard of? I think this may be my first. I’ve often thought it was the whole point of a biography; to see someone or something that you admire, and want to know how it happened to be. The tales of <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/adam-smith-by-nicholas-phillipson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Smith</a>, <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-first-tycoon-by-tj-stiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> and <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/the-accidental-billionares-by-ben-mezrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> come to mind. But the life of Sam Zemurray, the proverbial fish of this book&#8217;s title, is incredible even without prior knowledge. If not for his stunning role in bringing bananas to all of our diets, or his outsized impact on South America, his story of rags to riches deserves to be told for the other lessons. And one in particular.</p><br>
<p> </p><br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Zemurray&#8217;s life is a parable of the American dream &#8211; not history as recorded in textbooks, but the authentic cask-strength version, a subterranean saga of kickbacks, overthrows, and secret deals: the world as it really works.&#8221;</em></p><br>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<p>The story starts with Sam Zemurray, a penniless Russian immigrant, and his discovery of bananas &#8211; posited in numerous fantastical ways. It may sound strange to a modern reader, but bananas weren’t always common, they weren’t destined for smoothies. As a penniless Russian immigrant he had never seen or tasted a banana. And even in the new world, they were hardly a staple. He started small, buying the “waste” bananas of bigger companies, transporting and selling them for a small profit. His bunches became thousands, hundreds of thousands and then millions. Soon there were ships and plantations, railroads and soldiers. He funded a coup and took on the US Government, ran weapons and hired famous mercenaries. Along the way Zemurray and his business grew from something like a fruit-based arbitrage to a vertically integrated behemoth, and he brought the lowly banana along for the ride.</p><br>
<p> </p><br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;It was the worldview of the immigrant: understanding how so-called garbage might be valued under a different name, seeing nutrition where others saw only waste.”</em></p><br>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<p>Reading some of the other reviews of this book, a lot of the emphasis is placed on these, more fantastic aspects of Zemurray’s story. How he once owned most of Guatemala and fantastically took the helm of United Fruit &#8211; the proverbial whale &#8211; in a thrilling boardroom coup. But for me the big lesson is the fundamental aspect of Zemurray’s business: it was built on controlling waste and cost. Nowadays we like to glorify the people who think big and loud, want to fashion their world through grand visions, think Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Zemurray offers a competing path to success, one that is less flashy but also less flash in the pan. He picked the low hanging fruit, literally. His secret sauce wasn’t a new boat that could carry more bananas or carry them faster, it was good old fashioned stinginess.</p><br>
<p> </p><br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Selling hundreds of thousands of bananas a year, he&#8217;d become one of the biggest traffickers in the trade. And he&#8217;d done it without having to incur the traditional costs. His fruit was grown for him, harvested, and shipped for free.&#8221;</em></p><br>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br>
<p>Seizing the value of ripe fruit is an amazing innovation. It’s what allowed him not only to profit from, but compete with and eventually subsume his competition. The larger, less nimble corporations were not able to recognise what was laying in their laps. And it’s something we can all learn from: most of us don’t have the skills to create a killer app, the nous to build a rocket or the eye to demand design perfection, but we can all take a look around us to see what’s been wasted. Four stars.<br />
