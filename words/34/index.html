<h1><a href="/words/maybe-being-unfocused-is-a-good-thing/" class="post-header">Maybe being unfocused is a good thing</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So, I’m someone who has always been too curious for his own good. Just in the past few weeks I have been trying to <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BLf31hEh-G3/">learn how to pick locks</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BLrpdfEBTIQ/">make soap</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BG8TCrhE-gd/">build an aquaponic setup</a>. And those are just the things I can link to (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/joshcnicholas/">follow me on Instagram</a>).</p><br>
<p>I’ve often considered this a negative. My inability to focus on just one thing means I inevitably have less subject knowledge than someone who specialises. My knowledge is wide but not really deep. I can talk to almost anyone, about almost anything, but not for very long.</p><br>
<p>But just in time for some post hoc justification, economist Tim Harford has written a book that makes it all ok. It’s called <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Messy/9781594634796/?a_aid=thambili">Messy</a> and it’s an examination of the beauty of chaos. Most of the media coverage has concentrated on Harford’s message that untidy desks and workspaces can be a boon, but it really extends far beyond that. From the power of improvised speeches through random events that upset path dependence in your daily commute.</p><br>
<p>And riddled throughout are some amazing anecdotes just for curious people like me.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The top scientists switched topics frequently. Over the course of their first hundred published papers, the long-lived high-impact researchers switched topics an average of 43 times. The leaps were less dramatic than the ones Erez Aiden likes to take, but the pattern is the same: the top scientists keep changing the subject if they wish to stay productive.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The researchers investigated the creative habits of almost a hundred exceptionally creative people, including performers such as Ravi Shankar; Paul MacCready, who built the first human-powered aeroplane; Nobel laureates in literature such as Nadine Gordimer; twelve-time Emmy award-winning TV producer Joan Konner; great non-fiction writers such as Stephen Jay Gould; and a pair of double Nobel laureates, Linus Pauling and John Bardeen. Every single one of this galaxy of creative stars had multiple projects on the go at the same time.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Charles Darwin, who throughout his life alternated between research in geology, zoology, psychology and botany, always with some projects in the foreground and others in the background competing for his attention. He undertook his celebrated voyage on the Beagle with ‘an ample and unprofessional vagueness in his goals’.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few reasons Harford gives for the benefits of bouncing between projects. But in the end it seems to come back to something I have written about before – <a href="http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/">the necessity of letting in as many influences as you can</a>. There are some great rewards to be reaped by expanding your adjacent possible. Just think how important the interplay of geology, zoology, psychology and botany were in Darwin’s work. Would his theorising have been at all possible if he was a specialist?</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The practical benefit is that the multiple projects cross-fertilise one another. The knowledge gained in one enterprise provides the key to unlock another. This is Erez Aiden’s advantage. He moves back and forth across his network of enterprises, solving an impasse on one project with ideas from another or unexpectedly fusing two disparate lines of work.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p><!----></p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychological advantages may be just as important. First, the point emphasised by Brian Eno, is that a fresh context is exciting; having several projects may seem distracting, but instead the variety grabs our attention like a tourist gawping at details that a local would find mundane.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t enjoyed a non-fiction book this much in a long time. Not least because it justified my natural proclivities and confirmed my bias. Chaos is a fun topic and the sheer breadth of examples Harford employs keep it very fresh. Really recommend you go pick up <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Messy/9781594634796/?a_aid=thambili">Messy</a>.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/when-time-became-ubiquitous/" class="post-header">When time became ubiquitous</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>So I’ve just finished <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Longitude</a> by Dava Sobel, a great history of the struggle to create a reliable method of calculating longitude. It was a quest that lasted for hundreds of years, fuelled by rivalry, prejudice, discovery and war (also, a smidge of science).</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Lines of latitude and longitude began crisscorssing our worldview in ancient times, at least three centuries before the birth of Christ. By A.D. 150, the cartographer and astronomer Ptolemy had plotted them on the twenty-seven maps of his first world atlas.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>But while it’s easy to take a ruler to a map, orienting yourself on that map is another problem entirely. Especially so at sea, where landmarks are scarce. Lacking a way to devise longitude, countless lost their lives to navigational mistakes; shipwrecking or becoming hopelessly lost.</p><br>
<p>Luminaries from Galileo to Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke, as well as countless in between, worked to find a solution. Some were brilliant, if impractical – deriving longitude from the moon and stars; some were plain bizarre – a combination of magic powder and injured dogs.</p><br>
<p>In the end it came down to time. If you know the exact time where you are, as well as at your point of origin, longitude is child’s play to calculate. But creating an accurate timekeeper in the steampunk age, let alone one that holds up to a battering at sea, defied the best minds. In the end it was an uneducated carpenter named John Harrison who solved the problem.</p><br>
<p>He changed the world.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>Some modern horologists claim that Harrison’s work facilitated England’s mastery over the oceans, and thereby led to the creation of the British Empire — for it was by dint of the chronometer that Britainnia ruled the waves.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>But the thing that has really played on my mind over the past couple of days is not this “big history” aspect. Rather, Harrison and his clock marks the end of being without time. Our lives are so regimented now, everything on a schedule. And that’s before we even consider the important timekeeping continues to play in making our world smaller – through its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">use in GPS</a> for example.</p><br>
<p>Harrison extended rigorous timekeeping beyond cumbersome and stationary pendulum clocks, invented parts that can still be found in modern clocks, and brought time to the waves. It was through Harrison that time conquered the world.</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>With his marine clocks, John Harrison tested the waters of space-time. He succeeed, against all odds, in using the fourth-temporal-dimension to link points on the three-dimensional globe. He wrested the world’s whereabouts from the stars, and locked the secret in a pocket watch.</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>I really recommend <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Sobel’s book</a>. It’s well written and fascinating account.</p><br>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve just started reading a book called <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Longitude-Dava-Sobel/9780007214228/?a_aid=thambili">Longitude</a> by Dava Sobel. It’s a history of the scientific quest for a practical method of finding longitude.</p><br>
<p>Great minds from all over Europe, from Galileo to Isaac Newton, pursued an answer. And that’s what leads us to this great paragraph:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of their struggle to find longitude, scientists struck upon other discoveries that changed their view of the universe. These include the first accurate determinations of the weight of the Earth, the distance to the stars, and the speed of light.&quot;</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no idea what might come from the pursuit of knowledge. The connections we can draw. Important revelations along the way. Some research is often scapegoated around the time budgets get passed, used as a token of waste. But this is a big presumption.</p><br>
<p>Some of the best science and discovery really begins when assumptions and predictions fail. We have no idea the riches that curiosity will reveal.</p><br>

<h1><a href="/words/the-perils-of-being-a-non-coder/" class="post-header">The perils of being a non-coder</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Coding is the literacy of our age. Soon, knowing how to code is not going to be an option. I’ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now, as I’ve gone about making my podcast. For instance, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thinkdigitalfutures/are-we-doing-the-right-thing-with-tech-in-schools">talking to primary school children who can already do more with their phones than I can</a>.</p><br>
<p>This point was really rammed home when I cracked open <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Program-or-be-Programmed-Douglas-Rushkoff/9781593764265">Program or be Programmed</a> by Douglas Rushkoff.</p><br>
<p>The entire book is a plea to take control of the devices that have become so enmeshed in our lives. But it’s this bit early on that really makes it plain:</p><br>
<blockquote>
<p>“The people hear while the rabbis read; the people read while those with access to the printing press write; today we write, while our techno-elite programs. As a result, most of society remains one full dimensional leap of awareness and capability behind the few who manage to monopolize access to the real power of any media age.</p><br>
<p>And this time the stakes are actually higher. Before, failing meant surrendering our agency to a new elite. In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves. The process appears to have already begun.”</p><br>
</blockquote>
<p>Rushkoff has put coding into a continuum that includes literacy and mass media. Just think of the power that has accumulated to those who could read while the masses were unlettered, who could reach everyone while the rest of us shout in the wind.</p><br>
<p>And it’s not just that literacy and mass reach bestowed power, they did so in ways that no one could foresee, and that the unempowered didn’t understand.</p><br>
<p>But what started as superpowers of the rich and initiated, that for a time were specialist jobs (scribes and journalists), have been extended to all of us. Became required of all of us. And we are all richer for it.</p><br>
<p>Coding will be the same. It’s not going to remain a specialist activity, the purview of unseen developers, but will become as common as writing.</p><br>
<p>The other day I met a girl who had created an app so she could share the books she had read with her friends. A boy had been given an assignment to learn his school timetable, and so had created an app to automatically give himself reminders in the morning. These are primary school students.</p><br>
<p>Yes, these are really banal problems. But that’s exactly why they’re proof of how important coding will be. Technology is ubiquitous. Offline and online are being melded. Coding isn’t just about creating the next Google, but about fully realising something that is everywhere. Those of us who can’t, will be the unlettered of the modern age.</p><br>
