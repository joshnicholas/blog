<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>For the last several years, Whitham said, he and his colleagues had used a series of experimental gardens to study how plants are being affected by warming temperatures—in near real-time—and how their populations might evolve due to climate change&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;In these gardens, located in various ecosystems and elevations around the Southwest—from deserts to alpine forests—Whitham planted different genotypes of the same species&#8230; Preliminary results from his experimental gardens, 10 in total, suggest that <strong>species have already shifted their range in response to changing temperatures</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from an article that is <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/this-man-is-genetically-altering-ecosystems-to-save-them-from-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost three years old</a>.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="https://github.com/joshnicholas/Send-email-with-random-pocket-articles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote a script</a> to surface old articles from the bottom of my <a href="https://getpocket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a> queue. For years I have added more articles than I&#8217;ve read, creating a time capsule of sorts.</p>
<p>This is one of the first articles it spat out. But there&#8217;s been a pretty clear oeuvre &#8211; the variation, unpredictability and changing extremes associated with climate change have been presented to us consistently, over a long period.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now known about anthropogenic climate change for <a href="https://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/03/13/for-all-the.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entire generation</a>. And yet there is somehow still a <a href="https://overcast.fm/+QLhU25P8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debate about th</a><a href="https://overcast.fm/+QLhU25P8o">e suitability</a><a href="https://overcast.fm/+QLhU25P8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> of alarmism</a>.</p>
<p>There will of course be winners and losers to whatever action is taken, making resistance and motivated scepticism completely rational. But the clear lack of panic among those not already directly affected is not.</p>
<p>There is something broken among both our informational environments and our public discourse that we can continue to treat all of these instances as discrete events, rather than as of a whole. We should all be alarmed.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/apple-news-and-the-curation-problem/" class="post-header">Apple news and the curation problem</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>What is your platonic ideal of the news?</p>
<p>For me a perfect outfit, on a perfect day, would post one sentence: &#8220;nothing happened today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Go read a book. Grab a beer with friends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern media is not predicated on informing us only about what is important. Or respecting our time. Rather, they seek to monopolise it.</p>
<p>On a day when nothing happened they would still find something to shove in your face. Apple&#8217;s subscription news model will only make this worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/apple-launches-apple-news-plus-an-immersive-magazine-and-news-reading-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The plan</a> is to charge users a flat rate per month for access to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of newspapers and magazines. Publishers will apparently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-chafe-at-apples-terms-for-subscription-news-service-11549998416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">receive a share</a> &#8220;according to the amount of time users spend engaged with their articles&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words, publishers will have little incentive but to be as loud as possible. And to cover everything under the sun. They will be paraded and rewarded for catching our eye.</p>
<p>There is no incentive to engage in curation &#8211; publishers will have no direct relationship with customers. Apple will be curating further down the stack, but while it may be looking for &#8220;quality&#8221;, it <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/apple-launches-apple-news-plus-an-immersive-magazine-and-news-reading-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has used</a> total content consumed as a positive metric.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be signing up.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t live in a world where nothing will happen. But there is a next best &#8211; subscribe directly to people who value their own time enough not to waste yours.</p>
<p>Create a limited stream of content, populated only with those who value similar things.</p>
<p>I do this through RSS feeds and newsletters.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/were-really-bad-at-reality/" class="post-header">We’re really bad at reality</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Have you ever tried to mock up the outcome from a series of coin flips? It turns out that we are horrible at simulating randomness.</p>
<p>But as a great <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/70/variables/how-designers-engineer-luck-into-video-games-rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article in Nautilus</a> vividly illustrates, we&#8217;re also horrible at accepting randomness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;when video games truly play by the rules, the player can feel cheated. Sid Meier, the designer of the computer game Civilization, in which players steer a nation through history, politics, and warfare, quickly learned to modify the game’s odds in order to redress this psychological wrinkle. <strong>Extensive play-testing revealed that a player who was told that he had a 33 percent chance of success in a battle but then failed to defeat his opponent three times in a row would become irate and incredulous</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;So Meier altered the game to more closely match human cognitive biases; if your odds of winning a battle were 1 in 3, the game guaranteed that you’d win on the third attempt—a misrepresentation of true probability that nevertheless gave the illusion of fairness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notion of actual probability somehow being &#8220;unfair&#8221; is something to ponder. As is how the perversion of genuine probability can <em>feel </em>fair.</p>
<p>Are we more concerned with outcomes than opportunities?</p>
<p>It really is an excellent article and I recommend reading it all. It ranges from loaded dice found in ancient Egyptian tombs, to &#8220;pity timers&#8221; and faux improvement embedded in modern games, to gambling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The results of any modern slot machine are based on arcane random-number generators in a computerized network, not on the fortunate conjunction of three wooden wheels. But losing to that sort of luck can be dispiriting. <strong>So gambling machines often employ the fiction of physical luck</strong>—by, say, making it look as if you just missed out on a king’s ransom as the final matching bar of gold or lemon reels to a stop just shy of a jackpot payout. This entices you to once more bet on odds that remain astronomical.</p>

<h1><a href="/words/diversity-compounds/" class="post-header">Diversity compounds</a></h1>


<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>&#8230;we find that <strong>black students randomly assigned to a black teacher in grades K-3 are 5 percentage points (7%) more likely to graduate from high school and 4 percentage points (13%) more likely to enroll in college</strong> than their peers in the same school who are not assigned a black teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;We envision role model effects as information provision: black teachers provide a crucial signal that <strong>leads black students to update their beliefs about the returns to effort and what educational outcomes are possible</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w25254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an intriguing working paper</a> looking at natural experiments in Louisiana and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It fits with similar research into the importance and lasting effects of role models. They spur our dreams, change our attitudes, and shape our beliefs and expectations.</p>
<p>A superstar &#8211; especially one that is <em>like you</em> &#8211; can completely shatter self imposed limitations. Take this from <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous recent paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Girls are more likely to invent in a particular class if they grow up in an area with more women (but not men) who invent in that class&#8230; <strong>These findings suggest that there are many “lost Einsteins”</strong> – individuals who would have had highly impactful inventions had they been exposed to innovation in childhood – especially among women, minorities, and children from low-income families.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the west we tend to focus on the individual. Often in zero-sum situations.</p>
<p>But when you add in the context of previous and future generations, we all have a stake in a visible diversity of success.</p>
<p>It will spur the next generation. It compounds.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t we all benefit from fewer &#8220;lost Einstein&#8217;s&#8221;?</p>
