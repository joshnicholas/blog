However, it must be noted that this book is not simply a biography. Isaacson has delved deep not only into the life of Einstein, but also into the world that he inhabited and profoundly affected; the science of the 20th century and the history of the 21st century. While this does mean the book is often a bit slow and convoluted, it also means that it is incredibly informative. It brilliantly paints the portrait of a vivacious character, a person far more interesting than the sum of his famous work. Correspondingly it also brings a greater understanding of Einstein’s work (both scientific and otherwise), and how it greatly affects us even now.</p>\\n<p>So, as you would expect from a biography, Einstein by Walter Isaacson gives us a grand tour of the life of Albert Einstein. It tracks his life from birth to death, and visits many of the highlights along the way. Isaacson makes great use of much of Einsteins writings, as well the writings of his contemporaries. The book is littered with quotes from letters, essays and other publications, some by Einstein, some for Einstein and some about Einstein (apparently much of Einstein’s papers have only recently become available).

However, chances are over thousands of years there are traditional societies who have faced similar problems to ones we face and have tried different solutions; e.g. as children develop should parents and societies micromanage them in order to ensure their safety, or should they be allowed to run free and suffer the consequences of their actions? There are traditional societies that operate at both extremes of this spectrum, and thousands that operate in between, why don’t we observe them and see which is best practice? Or to provide another example; should we attempt to eradicate religion (as many atheists hope to do) or does it provide some tangible benefits that some cannot see? Again, there are thousands of traditional societies out there believing and practicing thousands of different things, maybe we should look at them and see what benefits they are receiving from their practices, compared to each other and compared to more secular societies. The examples and possibilities of such an approach to research and public policy are endless, and whether discussing political structures, legal, structures, war tactics, domestic politics, religion, language, and culture (among many, many other things), Diamond draws from examples from around the world to highlight what we can learn.</p>\\n<p>But with all this detail also comes a rather large downside.

The World Until Yesterday is Diamond’s latest publication, and was only\nreleased on Kindle on the 10th of January this year. I figured I could jump on\nthis book and maybe reference it a few times myself before it becomes passé.\nWhile I find the book to be very informative, it is an incredibly tough read,\nand often gets bogged down in minute details to the detriment of the overall\ngoal.\n\nThe World Until Yesterday is an ambitious project to look at “all aspects of\nhuman culture, of all people’s around the world, for the last 11,000 years”. \nBeginning with the prologue of Diamond checking in at an airport in Port\nmoresby, Papua New Guinea, Diamond sets out to describe the clash between the\nnew world and the ‘old’. Following on and broken into chapters, Diamond examines\ntraditional societies for the relationships within and between traditional\nsocieties, the particulars of war and peace, the way children and elderly people\nare treated, how fear and danger are harnessed and affect behaviour and quality\nof life, and the characteristics of languages and religions (this is far too\nshort a summary, it is big and very detailed book). Diamond then rounds out the\nbook with an epilogue of his returning from a field trip to Papua New Guinea,\nwhere he once again contrasts traditional life with his own life back in Los\nAngeles. But most importantly, as fits the subheading ‘What Can We Learn From\nTraditional Societies?’, throughout Diamond juxtaposes the aspects of\ntraditional societies with aspects of modern societies.\n\nThe idea behind this book is one I find brilliant. We should never stop learning\nfrom the experiences of others, and this book offers hundreds of examples of how\ntraditional societies have tackled different problems in different ways. As\nDiamond repeatedly points out; either due to scale or ethical concerns (etc.),\nand whether it is how children should be raised or how criminals should be\ntreated (etc.), modern societies are often unable or unwilling to carry out\nimportant experiments that could lead to best practice. However, chances are\nover thousands of years there are traditional societies who have faced similar\nproblems to ones we face and have tried different solutions; e.g. as children\ndevelop should parents and societies micromanage them in order to ensure their\nsafety, or should they be allowed to run free and suffer the consequences of\ntheir actions? There are traditional societies that operate at both extremes of\nthis spectrum, and thousands that operate in between, why don’t we observe them\nand see which is best practice? Or to provide another example; should we attempt\nto eradicate religion (as many atheists hope to do) or does it provide some\ntangible benefits that some cannot see? Again, there are thousands of\ntraditional societies out there believing and practicing thousands of different\nthings, maybe we should look at them and see what benefits they are receiving\nfrom their practices, compared to each other and compared to more secular\nsocieties. The examples and possibilities of such an approach to research and\npublic policy are endless, and whether discussing political structures, legal,\nstructures, war tactics, domestic politics, religion, language, and culture\n(among many, many other things), Diamond draws from examples from around the\nworld to highlight what we can learn.\n\nBut with all this detail also comes a rather large downside. This isn’t a book\nthat you can just pick up and read. It took me more than two weeks to read as I\noften had to get into a zone similar to studying. All of these examples can\nsometimes be laborious to get through or comprehend, and the names and regions\ncan become quite confusing. And while some examples are gripping (such as\nDiamond’s own first hand accounts), some of them can be downright tiresome.\nAlthough this is a well written book, it has not been written for general\nconsumption. Rather it is designed for those very interested in sociology, or\nthose looking for a book for research and to quote from (a job it will do quite\nhandily).\n\nAll in all, this is an astonishing book if you want to see how truly distinct\nmodern life is; whether it is how we view strangers (not as a threat but as a\nbanal backdrop to our lives), how we trade (not to seal relationships but to\nacquire goods and services we cannot produce ourselves), the role of leaders and\nthe state (not as mediators or spiritual guides, but as the institution with\nsole legitimate use of force within a society), or the legal system (not as an\ninstitute designed to re-establish relationships, but set out to ‘equalize\naccounts’, establish guilt and extract compensation). It is also an incredible\nbook if you want to look at the experience and the thousands of experiments\nconducted every day by traditional societies, and see if our societies can\nbenefit from this wealth of knowledge. I would not recommend this book for those\nwho are not keenly interested, it is not a book to be taken lightly. But for\nthose with the time, energy and interest, this is very much recommended.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-01-22T08:45:00.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:10:43.000Z","published_at":"2013-01-22T08:45:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb0f8","uuid":"9f9a480f-5f81-4405-a9d9-2a6a1a02f238","title":"Dead Aid","slug":"dead-aid","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>So I finally got around to reading “Dead Aid” by Dambisa Moyo, arguably her most famous wok, and one I see referenced quite often.

Goldsworthy maps out both Rome and its territories. He explains the functioning of the Republican system, with its infighting Senate picked from the Equestrian class, the order of magistrates that serve “limited” terms with “defined” powers and responsibilities, and a mob of plebeians who were both powerful and powerless. We are introduced to the principal actors of the day, which includes such names as Cicero, Pompey, Crassus, Cato and Claudius.

Goldsworthy readily and repeatedly admits that we don’t know much of the details about Caesar, one of the central points being when exactly he was born. Caesar’s journey to become Consul and his time as Consul is touched on briefly, but it is when Caesar is a Proconsul and goes off on his Governorship of Gaul that Goldsworthy really seems into his element. We learn in great detail about Caesar’s time in Gaul as he attempts to  “pacify” the Gauls and the Germans, fails to make headway in England, builds a never-ending stream of fortifications, roads and bridges, takes hostages, and caters for his army (apparently that last point is very important), all the while minding the political ramifications back home. Campaigns and battles are broken down to the slightest military maneuver (or our best guess at what happened during these battles based on the writings of Caesar, some of his men, and the scant archaeological evidence we have). I am sure by the end of the Gaul chapters most of us lay readers are eligible for some sort of degree in ancient warfare. For many the torrent of information about one battle or another may seem too much, but when you consider how Caesar’s mixture of skill, luck and daring contributed to his success, and how many others have drawn inspiration and knowledge from his campaigning, I believe the emphasis is more than justified. After all, Caesar become what he was largely through his military campaigns. The book is rounded out with the civil war with Pompey, and Caesar’s (relatively) short time as Dictator. I feel this section could have been longer, especially considering that many of us know of Caesar as a Dictator, and we have just gone through several hundred pages of build-up to this point, but this is just nitpicking really.</p>\\n<p>If you take a look at <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-author=Adrian%20Goldsworthy&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;search-alias=books&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;tag=joshnichocom-20\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Goldsworthy’s page on Amazon</a>, it is immediately clear that his expertise and interest lies with the Roman military. This is reflected in the book, as more than half the book deals with the period from Caesar becoming Governor of Gaul until the end of the civil war with Pompey. But if you don’t enjoy tales of military campaigns, or if you are willing to put up with the authors fascination with them, then there is a great detail of story and information for you regardless. Goldsworthy faces the horrific task of not only having to introduce us to Caesar, but inform us about an ancient world that many of us do not know about. This he does well. How did the Roman society and republic work? Who were Rome’s contemporaries and what challenges was Rome facing? Goldsworthy answers these questions and more, and he does it well enough that it is entertaining, interesting and sufficient to understand the man himself. Furthermore, something that I thoroughly enjoyed in this book was the constant stream of political commentary, both that of Goldsworthy as well as that of Caesar’s contemporaries. Alongside the account of Caesar’s actions, Goldsworthy offers glimpses of the political fallout for Caesar, his allies and his enemies. It gives you a real idea of the intention behind much of Caesars actions, and adds colour to a very political life that some biographies miss entirely. I really enjoyed learning about such a prominent historical figure, and this book was an amazing vehicle for doing so.

Caesar’s journey to become Consul and his time as Consul is touched on briefly, but it is when Caesar is a Proconsul and goes off on his Governorship of Gaul that Goldsworthy really seems into his element. We learn in great detail about Caesar’s time in Gaul as he attempts to  “pacify” the Gauls and the Germans, fails to make headway in England, builds a never-ending stream of fortifications, roads and bridges, takes hostages, and caters for his army (apparently that last point is very important), all the while minding the political ramifications back home.

I decided to begin with the\nbiography of Julius Caesar because he is such a looming figure throughout\nhistory and even in our modern culture. I grew up with references to Caesar; he\nwas the chief foil in the Asterix books I loved, my Grandma’s dog was/is named\nCaesar, and his name lives on in the titles Tsar (Tzar, Czar, Csar) and Kaiser\nthat are littered throughout our history textbooks. He has also inspired a great\nmany of the other people whose biographies are on my list; Napoleon being the\nobvious example. In particular this book is a brilliant telling of a truly scary\nand inspiring human being. But it isn’t just Caesar who is inspiring.\nGoldsworthy has managed to construct one of the best biographies I have ever\nread. He has walked the fine line between too much and too little detail, an\nespecially hard task when both the man and his world are so far removed from our\nown.\n\nGoldsworthy begins the story of Caesar by describing the world he came into: one\nwhere the kingdoms that had risen up in the wake of Alexander the Great were\nfading, where the four century-old Roman Republic was unopposed in the\nMediterranean but which was starting to reach the limits of what the Republican\nsystem would allow. Goldsworthy maps out both Rome and its territories. He\nexplains the functioning of the Republican system, with its infighting Senate\npicked from the Equestrian class, the order of magistrates that serve “limited”\nterms with “defined” powers and responsibilities, and a mob of plebeians who\nwere both powerful and powerless. We are introduced to the principal actors of\nthe day, which includes such names as Cicero, Pompey, Crassus, Cato and\nClaudius. But this is just the groundwork.\n\nAt first the story of Caesar focuses on the goings-on in Rome while Caesar grew\nup, became a man, and embarked on his career (many of these side events have\nlittle to do with Caesar at first, but come back to affect him later).\nGoldsworthy readily and repeatedly admits that we don’t know much of the details\nabout Caesar, one of the central points being when exactly he was born.

It was an idea, an aspiration, a model of piety inextricably\nlinked to the widespread sense of apocalyptic expectation that had seized the\nJews in the wake of the Roman occupation.”\n\n\n\n\nTo paraphrase Aslan, who is in turn paraphrasing Rudolf Bultmann, Aslan’s Jesus\nis a reflection of Aslan himself. He is the Jesus that Aslan wanted to find; a\nmortal man and a complete contradiction. Aslan has not succeeded in his quest to\nilluminate the life of Jesus. He hasn’t given us an objective account of the\nlife of Jesus, merely another interpretation. Where he has succeeded, however,\nis in inserting a fair amount of context into the life of Jesus. His portrait of\nthe workings of the Temple of Jerusalem, and the intrigue in and around\nJerusalem itself, are peerless. His highlighting of the succession of \"messiahs\"\nthat preceded and followed Jesus of Nazareth, the myriad of nationalist\nrebellions that took place and the reprisals that followed, and the general\nmilieu of Biblical Palestine are important additions to the popular debate over\nJesus and Christianity. And this is where the saving grace of this book lies. It\nis a book intended for popular consumption. Yes, many of the ideas found in the\nbook are not new, and some of the theorising is questionable. But the\nhistoricity of the modern conception of Jesus of Nazareth is something that\ndesperately needs to be challenged, as does the inerrancy of the Christian\nscriptures. This book is incredibly readable and it’s description of Biblical\npalestine and Jesus’s context brilliant. Let’s hope that this, along with it’s\nhigh profile, is enough to reignite the debate.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-12-29T00:48:00.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:10:32.000Z","published_at":"2013-12-29T00:48:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb0fb","uuid":"f0221ef5-dcea-4b24-8af2-1259075ea9d8","title":"The Bottom Billion","slug":"the-bottom-billion","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>The Bottom Billion is a couple of years old now, and some of the numbers and names are starting to look a little tired.

Only 15% of the world’s population live in the “global core”, while controlling more than 75% of income. The other 75%, those who live in the ‘periphery’ and control just 25% of income, can we really say they have equal opportunity? The 97% of those who still live in the same place as their fathers and grandfathers were born, can we say they have the same opportunity as the 3% lucky enough to follow the action? Only someone living under a rock would think that there is equal opportunity throughout the world. And only if there is freedom of movement, freedom to reach what little places do offer greater opportunity, could there possibly be any flattening. More so, migration even within some countries &#8211; China and North Korea for example &#8211; is tightly controlled. This means that for the vast majority of the world their destiny is inextricably intwined with the destiny of their place of birth. And even those fortunate enough to be born into developed countries &#8211; countries where there is ostensibly more opportunity, &#8211; they may not have had the fortune of being born in the right place within them. For example, children who are born in San Francisco have access to better public schools than those born in Minnesota, while literacy rates and healthcare access in rural (especially Aboriginal) communities in Australia are appalling compared to those in the major cities.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>“The power of place defines an aggregate of circumstances and conditions ranging from cultural traditions to natural phenomena, into which we are born, with which we cope, and from which we derive our own multiple identities.”</strong></em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In contrast to the proponents of a flat world, de Blij defines three types of people; mobals, locals and globals. The overwhelming majority of the world are ‘Locals’ &#8211; the “poorest” and “least mobile”, the 97% of the world who are restricted by various factors to live out their lives in their place of birth. The second type are ‘Mobals&#8217; &#8211; migrants, both legal and not, who are both able and willing to cross borders to facilitate better lives. And the third type are ‘Globals’ &#8211; those for whom the world really is flat. Globals are the businessmen and women, government workers and others for whom borders are all but insignificant. But really we must add to this, because even a successful businessman that was born in the wrong country will have trouble with movement and opportunity. It is the juxtaposition of the core and the periphery, the local and the global, the rich and the poor, the obstructed world and the flat, with which much of the book is concerned.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>“With less than 3 percent of the world’s people residing in a country other than that of their birth, it is clear that, for all of migration’s push and pull factors, the overwhelming majority confront the realities of the locale of their parents and grandparents.”</strong></em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Discussing what it is that restricts 97% of the world moving up the chain from local to global makes up the meat of the book. I touched on many of them in the opening paragraph. It’s things like language — where access to a global language can turn a local into a mobal, while monolingualism (whether forced or not) will undoubtedly curb opportunities for work and movement. Another barrier is being born a woman in the wrong place (de Blij calls Women “the most local of locals”), which immediately brings restrictions on education, movement, healthcare and self determination (etc.) even within countries with resources to burn. And even in what we would consider more enlightened areas, Women still face incredible barriers — domestic violence, unequal wages and glass ceilings etc. Education makes up another barrier, and there isn’t just a dichotomy between those who do and do not receive an education. Even for those who are fortunate enough to be educated not all is rosy — are they receiving the right education? Are they ready for the world of computers, or are they still stuck on the education conveyor-belt established by the Prussians? Religion is the next factor. As de Blij points out, religious differences often drive conflict and nationalism, especially when it comes to the apportioning of divine real estate. It is the Muslim extremists in parts of Pakistan that are throwing up the borders, as are the Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka (etc.), and it is the realms of Christendom and Islam to which a majority of the locals are born, and from which a majority of the mobals originate. I can’t go into all the factors, so I will highlight just one more — the natural world. An abundance of natural resources can be the bane of entrepreneurism through dutch disease, the life support of illiberalism through handouts, the sustenance of civil war, and the cause of policy inertia. A lack of natural resources can mean the difference between studying and fetching water, and the diversion of much needed infrastructure spending to import fossil fuels. Finally, a country that is isolated, landlocked, situated near fault lines, or that is under threat from climate change — like many islands in the pacific for instance — is all but a trap for those born there. Nothing highlights the power of place better than the world’s slipshod distribution of valuable resources, access and natural catastrophes.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong><em>“Malaria, perhaps more than any other malady, symbolises the contrasts between global core and periphery when it comes to health.”</em></strong></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>That last paragraph is just a taste of what I have picked up from de Blij’s book. Much of it is obvious, much of it is already covered in daily news reports, but the book’s framing really drives home how important luck is. However, a diagnosis of the situation is really all that de Blij offers. He has equipped me with a multitude of reasons for why the world looks like it does. Why it is so dominated by ‘the Core,&#8217; but the conclusion — entitled “lowering the barriers” — offers very little in guidance on how to fix the problem. It seems to boil down to meeting and altering the local circumstances that trap those that are stuck in the periphery — sexual discrimination, religious indoctrination, monolingualism, poor education, environmental disasters (etc.) — and spreading English and American culture. He even acknowledges that there are already ‘countless programs, projects, schemes, and plans’ already focused on doing just this, but doesn’t take it any further. As such, the book ends on a rather flat note.

Are they ready for the world of computers, or are they still stuck on the education conveyor-belt established by the Prussians? Religion is the next factor. As de Blij points out, religious differences often drive conflict and nationalism, especially when it comes to the apportioning of divine real estate. It is the Muslim extremists in parts of Pakistan that are throwing up the borders, as are the Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka (etc.), and it is the realms of Christendom and Islam to which a majority of the locals are born, and from which a majority of the mobals originate. I can’t go into all the factors, so I will highlight just one more — the natural world. An abundance of natural resources can be the bane of entrepreneurism through dutch disease, the life support of illiberalism through handouts, the sustenance of civil war, and the cause of policy inertia. A lack of natural resources can mean the difference between studying and fetching water, and the diversion of much needed infrastructure spending to import fossil fuels. Finally, a country that is isolated, landlocked, situated near fault lines, or that is under threat from climate change — like many islands in the pacific for instance — is all but a trap for those born there.

It’s all around us. It’s the\nreason why my German cousins have a life expectancy 7 years longer than my Sri\nLankan cousins. It’s why I breeze through customs in most countries with my\nBritish passport, while my highly esteemed Grandpa has to jump through hoops\nwith his Sri Lankan one. And it has resulted in thousands of Asylum Seekers\nlanguishing in detention on Nauru and Manus Island, caught in limbo while trying\nto reach the freedom and affluence that many Australians take for granted. As\nthe political world pivots towards inequality as a legitimate issue for debate\nand action, more focus needs to be placed on the role birthplace plays in\nopportunity. The Power of Place, through its influence on mother tongue,\nmovement, religion, education, health, natural environment, natural resources,\ncultural norms, and many other factors that de Blij explores; “remains the most\npotent factor shaping the destinies of billions”.\n\n\n\n“The power of place manifests itself in continua of opportunity and risk,\nadvantage and privation.”\n\n\n\nFrom the outset, de Blij sets his work in contrast to the likes of Thomas\nFriedman, those who claim the world is ‘flattening’ – that forces like\nglobalisation are creating a world of equal opportunity. As de Blij points out,\nthis is true for only a small minority of the world’s population – less than\nthree percent of the world’s population reside in a country other than that of\ntheir birth. Only 15% of the world’s population live in the “global core”, while\ncontrolling more than 75% of income. The other 75%, those who live in the\n‘periphery’ and control just 25% of income, can we really say they have equal\nopportunity? The 97% of those who still live in the same place as their fathers\nand grandfathers were born, can we say they have the same opportunity as the 3%\nlucky enough to follow the action? Only someone living under a rock would think\nthat there is equal opportunity throughout the world. And only if there is\nfreedom of movement, freedom to reach what little places do offer greater\nopportunity, could there possibly be any flattening. More so, migration even\nwithin some countries – China and North Korea for example – is tightly\ncontrolled. This means that for the vast majority of the world their destiny is\ninextricably intwined with the destiny of their place of birth. And even those\nfortunate enough to be born into developed countries – countries where there is\nostensibly more opportunity, – they may not have had the fortune of being born\nin the right place within them. For example, children who are born in San\nFrancisco have access to better public schools than those born in Minnesota,\nwhile literacy rates and healthcare access in rural (especially Aboriginal)\ncommunities in Australia are appalling compared to those in the major cities.\n\n\n\n“The power of place defines an aggregate of circumstances and conditions ranging\nfrom cultural traditions to natural phenomena, into which we are born, with\nwhich we cope, and from which we derive our own multiple identities.”\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the proponents of a flat world, de Blij defines three types of\npeople; mobals, locals and globals. The overwhelming majority of the world are\n‘Locals’ – the “poorest” and “least mobile”, the 97% of the world who are\nrestricted by various factors to live out their lives in their place of birth.\nThe second type are ‘Mobals’ – migrants, both legal and not, who are both able\nand willing to cross borders to facilitate better lives. And the third type are\n‘Globals’ – those for whom the world really is flat. Globals are the businessmen\nand women, government workers and others for whom borders are all but\ninsignificant. But really we must add to this, because even a successful\nbusinessman that was born in the wrong country will have trouble with movement\nand opportunity. It is the juxtaposition of the core and the periphery, the\nlocal and the global, the rich and the poor, the obstructed world and the flat,\nwith which much of the book is concerned.\n\n\n\n“With less than 3 percent of the world’s people residing in a country other than\nthat of their birth, it is clear that, for all of migration’s push and pull\nfactors, the overwhelming majority confront the realities of the locale of their\nparents and grandparents.”\n\n\n\nDiscussing what it is that restricts 97% of the world moving up the chain from\nlocal to global makes up the meat of the book. I touched on many of them in the\nopening paragraph. It’s things like language — where access to a global language\ncan turn a local into a mobal, while monolingualism (whether forced or not) will\nundoubtedly curb opportunities for work and movement. Another barrier is being\nborn a woman in the wrong place (de Blij calls Women “the most local of\nlocals”), which immediately brings restrictions on education, movement,\nhealthcare and self determination (etc.) even within countries with resources to\nburn. And even in what we would consider more enlightened areas, Women still\nface incredible barriers — domestic violence, unequal wages and glass ceilings\netc. Education makes up another barrier, and there isn’t just a dichotomy\nbetween those who do and do not receive an education. Even for those who are\nfortunate enough to be educated not all is rosy — are they receiving the right\neducation? Are they ready for the world of computers, or are they still stuck on\nthe education conveyor-belt established by the Prussians? Religion is the next\nfactor. As de Blij points out, religious differences often drive conflict and\nnationalism, especially when it comes to the apportioning of divine real estate.\nIt is the Muslim extremists in parts of Pakistan that are throwing up the\nborders, as are the Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka (etc.), and it is the\nrealms of Christendom and Islam to which a majority of the locals are born, and\nfrom which a majority of the mobals originate. I can’t go into all the factors,\nso I will highlight just one more — the natural world. An abundance of natural\nresources can be the bane of entrepreneurism through dutch disease, the life\nsupport of illiberalism through handouts, the sustenance of civil war, and the\ncause of policy inertia. A lack of natural resources can mean the difference\nbetween studying and fetching water, and the diversion of much needed\ninfrastructure spending to import fossil fuels. Finally, a country that is\nisolated, landlocked, situated near fault lines, or that is under threat from\nclimate change — like many islands in the pacific for instance — is all but a\ntrap for those born there. Nothing highlights the power of place better than the\nworld’s slipshod distribution of valuable resources, access and natural\ncatastrophes.\n\n\n\n“Malaria, perhaps more than any other malady, symbolises the contrasts between\nglobal core and periphery when it comes to health.”\n\n\n\nThat last paragraph is just a taste of what I have picked up from de Blij’s\nbook.

So, like teachers, Patterson suggests that journalists be trained in the fundamentals of what they need — history, analytical thinking, ethics, data analysis , etc. But also like teachers, they should be trained in communicating across these subjects. Providing context and other information in order that the audience can “make sense of the events”. According to Patterson, this “content knowledge” would take journalism a step closer to fulfilling its duty to democracy, all the while distancing it from the innumerable hacks who operate on the internet for free.

The lack of socially beneficial news and a common set of facts, as well as the incursion of infotainment into the “bible of democracy” has undoubtedly harmed the public square. I would be glad to see more informed voices take the stage. But I am sceptical that there is a place for such a development. Recent election coverage in Australia and America was abysmal, topped only by the bush-league reporting of the actual governance after the spectacle. But it is this, along with the blow-by-blow accounts of everything royal and celebrity, beat-ups and other fluff; that really pulls in the ratings. Look at what actually gets shared on social media. Its cat pictures and Upworthy, not the Washington Post or the Financial Times. Patternsons’ book gives a great account of much of what ails the news media.

Their preoccupation with\ncelebrities, disasters, scandals, crime, the political horserace, and other such\npabulum and infotainment. But Thomas E. Patterson also deplores the state of\ndemocracy, and views the two as inextricably linked. Just as ninety years ago\nWalter Lippmann warned the “crisis in Western Democracy is a crisis in\njournalism,” Patterson has sought to highlight the deficiencies in modern\njournalism, how it is affecting our ability to self-govern, and has offered an\nantidote; knowledge-based journalism.\n\n\n\n“It is a short step from misinformation to mischief, as we have seen repeatedly\nin recent policy.”\n\nAround the world, studies measuring trust and satisfaction consistently put\njournalists at the bottom of professions. Even below politicians. All the while,\nthe traditional mass media lose audience to the purveyors of satire, punditry\nand hackery. The financial issues facing the journalism industry are well\ndocumented, but as Patterson points out throughout the book, there is a deeper\ncrisis facing the profession. Journalism has become dumbed down. Even name-brand\njournalism schools have structured their courses to more resemble trade schools\nthan instructors of a vital component in a functioning democracy. Journalists\nincreasingly have little experience or knowledge in the subjects that they\ncover. While technical expertise may be exemplary, content expertise is often\nlacking.\n\n“It is nearly impossible to have sensible public deliberation when large numbers\nof people are out of touch with reality.”\n\nIn an age of tight deadlines and slimmed down newsrooms, this is a disaster for\ncreating an informed public. Serious policy is overlooked while much simpler —\nfor the journalist as well as the consumer — political hackery is played up.\nMinor but easy to understand developments — such as interest and inflation blips\n— are held under the microscope, while the larger picture — the state of the\nbusiness cycle for example — is all but lost. Powerful figures — such as those\nwho pushed for the invasion of Iraq – are left unchecked by those ill equipped\nto do so. All the while, journalists must rely ever more on outsiders to do\nfundamental aspects of their jobs — providing context and scrutiny in a world\nbursting with information. Studies show that the public are consistently\nmisinformed on a variety of important subjects, and, as Patterson points out,\nmany of these subjects bear a startling correlation to the innate biases of a\nprofession that is chasing its audience and has lost sight of its intellectual\nrigour. Is there any doubt of the cumulative effect?\n\n“Informed citizens do not spring forth from birth. The process of informing the\npublic is an ongoing task”\n\nFor Patterson, the answer to both conundrums is the injection of “knowledge”\nback into journalism. Specifically, the “knowledge of how to use knowledge”.\nObviously, the variety of subjects that any one journalist will encounter during\na career is too much to become intimate with all of it. But similar can be said\nof a teacher. So, like teachers, Patterson suggests that journalists be trained\nin the fundamentals of what they need — history, analytical thinking, ethics,\ndata analysis , etc. But also like teachers, they should be trained in\ncommunicating across these subjects. Providing context and other information in\norder that the audience can “make sense of the events”. According to Patterson,\nthis “content knowledge” would take journalism a step closer to fulfilling its\nduty to democracy, all the while distancing it from the innumerable hacks who\noperate on the internet for free. Knowledge, Patterson claims, is the solution\nto more than one of the problems that plagues journalism.\n\n“Knowledge is the starting point as well as the end product of systematic\ninquiry, guiding the practitioner in what to look for as well as what to make of\nwhat is found.”\n\nAs a citizen, an avid news consumer, and someone who spends considerable time in\na newsroom every week, Pattersons’ book rings horribly true on many levels. The\nlack of socially beneficial news and a common set of facts, as well as the\nincursion of infotainment into the “bible of democracy” has undoubtedly harmed\nthe public square.

He’s a prominent science\nwriter, with several other great books out there (a review ofThe Information\n[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400096235/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400096235&linkCode=as2&tag=joshnichocom-20&linkId=WJ6W55WGRAF7MDIH] \nis forthcoming). But the deftness with which he brings science to the less\nerudite is really on show with this biography. It’s not a long book, more of a\nNewton summary really, but it hits the high points. It begins with a visit to\nWoolsthorpe – where Newton was born, works through his education and scientific\nawakening, and finishes with Newton’s legacy. That last subject being something\nthat could fill whole libraries.\n\n> “What Newton learned remains the essence of what we know, as if by our own\nintuition”\n\n\nFor a small book — my edition comes in at under two hundred pages — there is an\nincredible amount to be gleaned about the life of Isaac Newton. How many of us\nreally consider Isaac Newton the ostensible orphan? When school children learn\nabout his theories in science textbooks, do we realise how hard up the young\nNewton was for simple paper and pens, let alone textbooks? When we imagine him\nsitting under the Apple tree (surely a myth), do we conjure the ways the young\nNewton really did turn the natural world into a veritable laboratory? How many\nof us imagine a man famous for calculating his way through the mysterious of the\ncosmos, also filling notebooks with the ingredients for paint, the Bible’s\nhidden codes, and lists of thousands of nouns in different languages (etc.)? His\nforays into alchemy and other scorned fields are legendary, but did you know\nNewton had to be goaded into publishing his legitimate work? Even his famous\nPrincipia? Textbooks and popular imagination give us an image of Newton as a\nrobot genius. But Gleick reveals him to be so much more. An irascible yet modest\nman, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge changed the world.\n\n> “It was nature’s destiny now to be mathematised. Henceforth space would have\ndimension and measure; the moon would be subject to geometry.”\n\n\nNewton’s life is fascinating, and, as all good biographers do, Gleick has\nrevealed his subject to be much more than our cartoonish popular conception. The\nbook is well written, really, I demolished it in a day. But it’s arguable how\nmuch this is due to it’s readability as to it’s length. And it’s the length that\ngets me. Gleick really, manages little more than pulling back the curtain on a\ngiant of the modern age. And when you consider how much context he must provide\n— on the age of Enlightenment, the wars with Hooke and Leibniz over no less than\nGravity and Calculus (etc.) — it’s no wonder we emerge on the other end having\nbarely touched his personality or character. Newton was a revolutionary, his\nshadow still falls over science, economics, mathematics, philosophy, theology,\nand much, much more. As a short dip into his life and works, Gleick’s book is\nmore than sufficient. As a study of one of the most influential men in history,\nit leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n> “No one feels the burden of Newton’s legacy, looming forward from the past, more\nthan the modern scientist. A worry nags at his descendants: that Newton may have\nbeen too successful; that the power of his methods gave them too much\nauthority.”\n\n\nTitle: Isaac Newton\n[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032954/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400032954&linkCode=as2&tag=joshnichocom-20&linkId=WU6LXZFPN6JMW4S4]\n\nAuthor: James Gleick\n\nPages: 191 (Paperback)\n\nJosh’s Rating: 3/5\n\nAmazon Link: Isaac Newton\n[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032954/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400032954&linkCode=as2&tag=joshnichocom-20&linkId=WU6LXZFPN6JMW4S4]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-11-02T00:44:00.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:10:04.000Z","published_at":"2014-11-02T00:44:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb102","uuid":"58a1ae61-1ae4-4ee1-96a7-d13416509196","title":"The Accidental Billionares","slug":"the-accidental-billionares","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>Facebook has become all-pervasive.

I would hear of Muhammad’s return to Mecca, his clearing the Kabah of pagan idols, and his fight for social justice and the empowerment of Women. It’s a version of Muhammad I can understand. It fits my family.</span></p>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“The history of a religious tradition is a continuous dialogue between a transcendent reality and current events in the mundane sphere.”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">But this image has become muddled. It’s clear that there are many visions of who Muhammad was and what he means. Much of my life has taken place against the backdrop of a cosmic war — planes flying into buildings, invasions, car bombs and police raids. And Muhammad has been invoked, repeatedly, by all sides. Used to justify all manner of atrocities. This tension has become especially meaningful in the past few months, as gunmen attempt to police his image on our own doorsteps.</span></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“We have a long history of Islamophobia in Western culture that dates back to the time of the Crusades. In the twelfth century, Christian monks in Europe insisted that Islam was a violent religion of the sword, and that Muhammad was a charlatan who imposed his religion on a reluctant world by force of arms; they called him a lecher and asexual pervert.”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">So, who was Muhammad? The benevolent and merciful figure that I’ve grown up with? The man who inspires the billion plus Muslims who go about their days peaceably, who we never hear from? Or was he the great Muslim crusader that the Islamic Fundamentalists tout? How about the bloodthirsty tyrant that many of his obstreperous critics claim? As the cosmic war of the past decade is joined by a culture war, increasingly on our own doorsteps, this is a question that needs answering. And so, I turned to Karen Armstrong.</span></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“The work of Muhammad’s first biographers would probably not satisfy a modern historian. They were men of their time and often included stories of a miraculous and legendary nature that we would interpret differently today.”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Muhammad has had many biographers, the first emerging a hundred or so years after his death. However, like many other religious figures, the bulk of our knowledge comes from the scriptures, which in turn rely on an oral history. Armstrong begins the story with Muhammad’s first revelation, when he was forty years old. But she quickly backtracks and takes us through the religious, cultural and economic context of Muhammad’s time. Aspects of his life that are inseparable from his teachings and legacy, but are rarely mentioned now. We learn about his birth into the Hashim clan in Mecca, an important clan in a powerful city. His marriage to Khadijah in his twenties Khadijah was employer and a rich widow with whom he would remain monogamous (not the norm) until her death. And as the short 200-odd pages go by, we follow the slow creation of Islam, the Muslim exile to Medina and their struggle to return. All set in the context of the wider Arabian world that both influenced and was influenced by them.</span></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“Muhammad literally sweated with the effort to bring peace to war-torn Arabia, and we need people who are prepared to do this today. His life was a tireless campaign against greed, injustice, and arrogance. He realised that Arabia was a turning point and that the old way of thinking would no longer suffice, so he wore himself out in the creative effort to evolve an entirely new solution.”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">This focus on context is brilliant. After all, Muhammad’s tale is like many other stories from pre-modernity &#8211; awful when the context is removed. However, there are also weaknesses with Armstrong’s account. The most obvious is that it is entirely uncritical. Apart from a brief mention at the beginning, there is scarce reference to the fact that the entire story is built upon an oral history of Muhammad’s followers. And yet, it is also written with absolute certainty. There are no questions given to the possibility of bad memory, an incomplete historical record, or alteration through retelling. This problem is especially clear when Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s reputation for honesty and grace &#8211; it may be so, but his followers would say that wouldn&#8217;t they? And since the scriptures are God’s revelations channeled through Muhammad, from where does this survey of his contemporaries emanate? Even worse, such hagiographic characterisations are often accompanied by literary flourishes and insights into the Prophet’s own mind &#8211; what are the sources for these intrusions? I would greatly love to read the tome in which his every sigh and facial expression are also recorded.</span></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“The Qur’an is the holy word of God, and it’s authority remains absolute. But Muslims know that it is not always easy to interpret. Its laws were designed for a small community…”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">For those who don’t mind a critical account, there is another big issue &#8211; the question of Muhammad’s agency. The context-centric approach means that most of the events are portrayed as a reaction to external cultural and political events. For example; the rival Quraysh clan does something, and suddenly Muhammad is gifted the perfect revelation and strategy. What comes off is both a God and Prophet in thrall to outside events, responding to the world rather than shaping it. Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s disdain for metaphysics, but should we come away with such an emphasis on politics? A cynical reading could conclude that Muhammad doesn’t have agency, and that many of these revelations are quite convenient. Is that the intention? If so, who exactly is the target audience of this account?</span></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><i>“If we are to avoid catastrophe, the Muslim and Western worlds must learn not merely to tolerate but to appreciate one another. A good place to start is with the figure of Muhammad: a complex man, who resists facile, ideologically-driven categorisation, who sometimes did things that were difficult or impossible for us to accept, but who had profound genius and founded a religion and cultural tradition that was not based on the sword but whose name — “Islam” — signified peace and reconciliation.”</i></span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">To answer my conundrum from earlier, Armstrong paints a picture of Muhammad quite close to the one I was brought up with. Only much richer than my family could ever manage. He wasn&#8217;t the man claimed by the fundamentalists on either side, but a man of his time. The context she provides is eye opening, and definitely an important addition to our current debate. But Armstrong&#8217;s lack of criticism is really the takeaway. It invalidates it for anyone who wants as “true” a picture as possible.

I would hear of Muhammad’s return to Mecca, his clearing the Kabah of pagan idols, and his fight for social justice and the empowerment of Women. It’s a version of Muhammad I can understand. It fits my family.</span></p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The history of a religious tradition is a continuous dialogue between a transcendent reality and current events in the mundane sphere.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But this image has become muddled. It’s clear that there are many visions of who Muhammad was and what he means. Much of my life has taken place against the backdrop of a cosmic war — planes flying into buildings, invasions, car bombs and police raids. And Muhammad has been invoked, repeatedly, by all sides. Used to justify all manner of atrocities. This tension has become especially meaningful in the past few months, as gunmen attempt to police his image on our own doorsteps.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“We have a long history of Islamophobia in Western culture that dates back to the time of the Crusades. In the twelfth century, Christian monks in Europe insisted that Islam was a violent religion of the sword, and that Muhammad was a charlatan who imposed his religion on a reluctant world by force of arms; they called him a lecher and asexual pervert.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, who was Muhammad? The benevolent and merciful figure that I’ve grown up with? The man who inspires the billion plus Muslims who go about their days peaceably, who we never hear from? Or was he the great Muslim crusader that the Islamic Fundamentalists tout? How about the bloodthirsty tyrant that many of his obstreperous critics claim? As the cosmic war of the past decade is joined by a culture war, increasingly on our own doorsteps, this is a question that needs answering. And so, I turned to Karen Armstrong.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The work of Muhammad’s first biographers would probably not satisfy a modern historian. They were men of their time and often included stories of a miraculous and legendary nature that we would interpret differently today.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Muhammad has had many biographers, the first emerging a hundred or so years after his death. However, like many other religious figures, the bulk of our knowledge comes from the scriptures, which in turn rely on an oral history. Armstrong begins the story with Muhammad’s first revelation, when he was forty years old. But she quickly backtracks and takes us through the religious, cultural and economic context of Muhammad’s time. Aspects of his life that are inseparable from his teachings and legacy, but are rarely mentioned now. We learn about his birth into the Hashim clan in Mecca, an important clan in a powerful city. His marriage to Khadijah in his twenties Khadijah was employer and a rich widow with whom he would remain monogamous (not the norm) until her death. And as the short 200-odd pages go by, we follow the slow creation of Islam, the Muslim exile to Medina and their struggle to return. All set in the context of the wider Arabian world that both influenced and was influenced by them.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Muhammad literally sweated with the effort to bring peace to war-torn Arabia, and we need people who are prepared to do this today. His life was a tireless campaign against greed, injustice, and arrogance. He realised that Arabia was a turning point and that the old way of thinking would no longer suffice, so he wore himself out in the creative effort to evolve an entirely new solution.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This focus on context is brilliant. After all, Muhammad’s tale is like many other stories from pre-modernity &#8211; awful when the context is removed. However, there are also weaknesses with Armstrong’s account. The most obvious is that it is entirely uncritical. Apart from a brief mention at the beginning, there is scarce reference to the fact that the entire story is built upon an oral history of Muhammad’s followers. And yet, it is also written with absolute certainty. There are no questions given to the possibility of bad memory, an incomplete historical record, or alteration through retelling. This problem is especially clear when Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s reputation for honesty and grace &#8211; it may be so, but his followers would say that wouldn&#8217;t they? And since the scriptures are God’s revelations channeled through Muhammad, from where does this survey of his contemporaries emanate? Even worse, such hagiographic characterisations are often accompanied by literary flourishes and insights into the Prophet’s own mind &#8211; what are the sources for these intrusions? I would greatly love to read the tome in which his every sigh and facial expression are also recorded.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“The Qur’an is the holy word of God, and it’s authority remains absolute. But Muslims know that it is not always easy to interpret. Its laws were designed for a small community…”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don’t mind a critical account, there is another big issue &#8211; the question of Muhammad’s agency. The context-centric approach means that most of the events are portrayed as a reaction to external cultural and political events. For example; the rival Quraysh clan does something, and suddenly Muhammad is gifted the perfect revelation and strategy. What comes off is both a God and Prophet in thrall to outside events, responding to the world rather than shaping it. Armstrong repeatedly asserts Muhammad’s disdain for metaphysics, but should we come away with such an emphasis on politics? A cynical reading could conclude that Muhammad doesn’t have agency, and that many of these revelations are quite convenient. Is that the intention? If so, who exactly is the target audience of this account?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“If we are to avoid catastrophe, the Muslim and Western worlds must learn not merely to tolerate but to appreciate one another. A good place to start is with the figure of Muhammad: a complex man, who resists facile, ideologically-driven categorisation, who sometimes did things that were difficult or impossible for us to accept, but who had profound genius and founded a religion and cultural tradition that was not based on the sword but whose name — “Islam” — signified peace and reconciliation.”</i></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To answer my conundrum from earlier, Armstrong paints a picture of Muhammad quite close to the one I was brought up with. Only much richer than my family could ever manage. He wasn&#8217;t the man claimed by the fundamentalists on either side, but a man of his time. The context she provides is eye opening, and definitely an important addition to our current debate. But Armstrong&#8217;s lack of criticism is really the takeaway. It invalidates it for anyone who wants as “true” a picture as possible. Granted, in our current climate it is understandable why Armstrong could not do for Muhammad what <a href=\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/zealot-by-reza-aslan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reza Aslan did for Jesus</a>, but Muhammad already has enough hagiographies.

And, finally, collateralised debt obligations, sub prime\nmortgages and the Global Financial Crisis.\n\n\n\n“When we withdraw banknotes from automated telling machines, or invest portions\nof our monthly salaries in bonds and stocks, or insure our cars, or remortgage\nour homes, or renounce home bias in favour of emerging markets, we are entering\ninto transactions with many historical antecedents.”\n\n\n\nIt’s with that last point that Ferguson really strikes home. The final parts of\nthe book deal with the complexity of the modern financial system, and how it\nunravelled in the period leading up to publication. For while all these great\ninnovations have built the world we now inhabit, they have also created one so\ncomplex that many simply give up. But we can’t. Giving up is what allows the\nlikes of sub-prime loans to promulgate, and myriad mistakes be remade.\nFerguson’s book is a partial answer to that. It’s nowhere near the silver bullet\n— for more sophisticated readers, there is much to be desired (Adam Smith seems\nto be particularly glossed over, for example), but it’s a great overview. And\nFerguson’s passion for anecdote makes it particularly enjoyable.

I think this may be my first. I’ve often thought it was the whole point of a biography; to see someone or something that you admire, and want to know how it happened to be.

But the life of Sam Zemurray, the proverbial fish of this book&#8217;s title, is incredible even without prior knowledge. If not for his stunning role in bringing bananas to all of our diets, or his outsized impact on South America, his story of rags to riches deserves to be told for the other lessons. And one in particular.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em>&#8220;Zemurray&#8217;s life is a parable of the American dream &#8211; not history as recorded in textbooks, but the authentic cask-strength version, a subterranean saga of kickbacks, overthrows, and secret deals: the world as it really works.&#8221;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The story starts with Sam Zemurray, a penniless Russian immigrant, and his discovery of bananas &#8211; posited in numerous fantastical ways. It may sound strange to a modern reader, but bananas weren’t always common, they weren’t destined for smoothies. As a penniless Russian immigrant he had never seen or tasted a banana. And even in the new world, they were hardly a staple. He started small, buying the “waste” bananas of bigger companies, transporting and selling them for a small profit. His bunches became thousands, hundreds of thousands and then millions. Soon there were ships and plantations, railroads and soldiers. He funded a coup and took on the US Government, ran weapons and hired famous mercenaries. Along the way Zemurray and his business grew from something like a fruit-based arbitrage to a vertically integrated behemoth, and he brought the lowly banana along for the ride.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em>&#8220;It was the worldview of the immigrant: understanding how so-called garbage might be valued under a different name, seeing nutrition where others saw only waste.”</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Reading some of the other reviews of this book, a lot of the emphasis is placed on these, more fantastic aspects of Zemurray’s story. How he once owned most of Guatemala and fantastically took the helm of United Fruit &#8211; the proverbial whale &#8211; in a thrilling boardroom coup. But for me the big lesson is the fundamental aspect of Zemurray’s business: it was built on controlling waste and cost. Nowadays we like to glorify the people who think big and loud, want to fashion their world through grand visions, think Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Zemurray offers a competing path to success, one that is less flashy but also less flash in the pan. He picked the low hanging fruit, literally. His secret sauce wasn’t a new boat that could carry more bananas or carry them faster, it was good old fashioned stinginess.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em>&#8220;Selling hundreds of thousands of bananas a year, he&#8217;d become one of the biggest traffickers in the trade. And he&#8217;d done it without having to incur the traditional costs. His fruit was grown for him, harvested, and shipped for free.&#8221;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Seizing the value of ripe fruit is an amazing innovation.

And even in the new world, they were hardly a staple. He started small, buying the “waste” bananas of bigger companies, transporting and selling them for a small profit. His bunches became thousands, hundreds of thousands and then millions. Soon there were ships and plantations, railroads and soldiers.

After all, it’s the story of three twenty-year olds with little experience in business or philanthropy, creating one of Australia’s most successful social enterprises &#8211; selling water, food and hygiene products to fund projects in developing countries. The ups and downs are half the fun.</p>\\n<p>But my favourite section comes right at the end, as Flynn reflects on this, the first chapter of his story.</p>\\n<blockquote><p><em>“with less financial restrictions comes the temptation to pump money into things simply because you’ve got the budget for it. In doing so, you run the very high risk of spending on something that’s an average idea.”</em></p></blockquote>\\n<p>A running theme throughout Flynn’s story are the odds in the way &#8211; his organisation, often buoyed only by belief and passionate supporters, facing off against entrenched interests and disbelieving middlemen. The story of Thankyou becomes the story of finding workarounds, of skipping the first step and coming back to it later.</p>\\n<p>As someone who writes a lot about startups, steeped in press releases about seed funding and the necessity of more capital, this is refreshing. Thankyou is a brand selling physical products, unlike someone purveying digital goods, the barriers to entry for Thankyou have been very high, but they always found a way. Thankyou was constantly validating, having to prove themselves.

Kleon is rather insistent on the concept that everything new is\ninherently informed by what has come before. There are no new ideas, but plays\non old ones. Borrowings, remixes and mashups. As a result, it is vitally\nimportant to watch what you allow in. What you consume is directly tied to what\nyou create.\n\n> “Just as you have a familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas. You\ndon’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick\nyour friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books\nyou read and you can pick the movies you see.”\n\n\nA similar idea runs through Johnson’s book, which is full of beautiful examples\nof inventors “borrowing” from other fields. My favourite is Gutenberg, whose\nprinting press repurposed a bunch of pre-existing technologies – movable type,\nink, paper, and the wine press – a tool ubiquitous in his homeland. The\nGutenberg press wasn’t the result of a stroke of brilliance, a revolution or\ntechnological leap forward, but of remixing things that already existed.\n\nOf course, it’s not enough to just open your mind and let all the good stuff in.\nAfter all, I have far more access to ideas and information than any of my 17th\ncentury heroes. So Johnson introduces another, related idea, the commonplace\nbook:\n\n> “Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters – just about anyone with\nintellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to\nkeep a commonplace book. The great minds of the period – Milton, Bacon, Locke –\nwere zealous believers in the memory-enhancing powers of the commonplace book.”\n\n\n> “In its most customary form, “commonplacing,” as it was called, involved\ntranscribing interesting or inspirational passages from one’s reading,\nassembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations.”\n\n\nImbibing good stuff is the first step. From there, you need to do something with\nit. Write it down. Try and draw some connections. Read and re read it.\nApparently this was something Darwin was wont to do, as he not only took down\nnew ideas, but reasoned them out on paper.\n\n> “Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a\ncontinuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you\ncould read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you\nmade a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.”","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2016-04-05T21:26:04.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:09:27.000Z","published_at":"2016-04-05T21:26:04.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb10b","uuid":"121739a9-d5a8-4516-a8f6-deda007f5e21","title":"You need to expand the limit to your creative potential","slug":"there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p><a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/23jZO1I\\\">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.

But this isn’t an argument that can be fought on moral grounds. It never has been.</p>\\n<p>The rise of populists and anti-immigration movements is motivated, in large part, by genuine fear. Australians are seeing <a href=\\\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-18/wage-price-index-abs-data/7424912\\\">record low wage growth</a>, Americans are seeing <a href=\\\"https://psmag.com/the-future-of-work-why-wages-aren-t-keeping-up-6fcfac468e4#.q8fdapro7\\\">similar real wage stagnation</a>, and other nations are too. Meanwhile, the European unemployment rate is heading in the right direction, but is <a href=\\\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/unemployment-rate\\\">still shockingly high</a>, especially in <a href=\\\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate\\\">some states</a>, leaving the spectre of a lost generation. And all of this is against the backdrop of the largest technological shift since the industrial revolution.</p>\\n<p>With this context it’s understandable that millions of refugees look less than appealing. That the <em>other</em>, especially an easily demonised <em>other</em>, is feeling the brunt. People are genuinely worried about putting food on the table, for their futures and children — let’s not go into zero-sum thinking fostered by our politicians and education systems.</p>\\n<p>The point is, this isn’t a debate you can tackle with “well, it’s the least we can do”. You need an equally self-interested argument. And I may have found one.</p>\\n<p>I’ve just finished the first chapter of <a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/1TPIKH1\\\">The Geography of Genius</a>, a splendidly written first-person investigation of the connection between place and ideas. The author, Eric Weiner, is a long-time foreign correspondent and travel writer, so you can imagine the beautiful language and imagery.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the first chapter is an investigation of ancient Athens. Why was this one place the progenitor of so much we take for granted — art, science, finance, literature, philosophy, and politics etc.? This is especially remarkable given the short span of Athen’s golden age, and that it wasn’t the richest or biggest of the Greek states.</p>\\n<p>The Athenians were particularly creative — dare I say, innovative. And the reason why comes back to <a href=\\\"http://www.joshnicholas.com/there-is-a-limit-to-your-creative-potential/\\\">something I’ve written about before</a> — they had a lot of raw material. Athens was an incredibly open place, it’s people travelling widely, and, extraordinarily for the time, foreigners were allowed to come and thrive. All of these influences came together and mixed, illustrating deficiencies not immediately apparent to locals, surfacing solutions from far and wide.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“The ancient Greeks didn’t invent much at all. They were, in fact, tremendous moochers. They borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, medicine and sculpture from the Egyptians, mathematics from the Babylonians, literature from the Sumerians. They felt no shame in their intellectual pilfering. The Athenians, for all their many flaws (see slavery and treatment of women), didn’t suffer from the Not Invented Here complex.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“This willingness to borrow, steal, and embellish distinguished Athens from its neighbors. Athenians were more open to foreign ideas and, in the final analysis, more open-minded. At the symposia, they enjoyed the poetry of outsiders as much as that of locals. They incorporated many foreign words into their vocabulary and even began wearing foreign clothes. Athens was both Greek and foreign, in much the way that New York is an American city and not.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>At one point, Weiner very clearly links this openness and cross-pollination to commerce. Something we can see in some of today’s more interesting technology companies — <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransferWise\\\">Transferwise</a>, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp\\\">WhatsApp</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)\\\">Telegram</a> were all founded by immigrants and exiles, largely solving problems not evident in their new homes. Nevertheless, they bring an incredible amount of wealth and expertise. Would any of these countries be better for locking them out?</p>\\n<p>The reverse example is also present, as evidenced by Facebook’s spectacular failure to bring Free Basics to India, <a href=\\\"http://www.afr.com/technology/why-facebook-and-marc-andreessen-offended-india-with-good-intentions-20160216-gmv4u4\\\">largely thanks to a lack of cultural awareness</a>. Diversity is an incredibly powerful facet in the creation and dissemination of ideas. Even if you don’t immediately benefit from the diversity, you may do so indirectly — you might not get a job with Facebook, but your life is undoubtedly richer from greater access to friends and family.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“The Athenians, master shipbuilders and sailors, journeyed to Egypt, Mesopotamia, and beyond and brought back every good imaginable. Embedded in those goods were some stowaways: ideas.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Ideas insert themselves into the fiber of merchandise and lie dormant until a careful observer unlocks them. This is why authoritarian regimes that believe they can open their economies but not their politics are fooling themselves. It may take a while, but eventually these subversive ideas, embedded in a can of tomato soup or a pair of Crocs, squirm free.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One of my favourite classes during university was a history of China, a central theme being the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism#China\\\">country’s cycles of expansion and isolation</a>, and the accompanying booms and busts. Similarly, it can be argued that much of America’s success over the past hundred years comes from its immigration policy, its openness. Its being built on an idea, <a href=\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-america-is-being-changed--but-by-whom/2016/02/11/834d3dca-d105-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html\\\">rather than a foundation of race, ethnicity or religion</a>. We have so much evidence that openness works, that closing doors is nothing more than self harm.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, much of these issues are viewed through a zero-sum lens. Each additional immigrant is feared as a source of more competition, rather than for any of the number of benefits they provide.

It was obvious to\nme that Trump would not win. And this was shared by everyone I spoke to, both\nbefore and after the event.\n\nBut this certainty, especially this shared sense of the obvious, is a problem.\nAs explained by Dave Gray in his book Liminal Thinking\n[https://www.amazon.com/Liminal-Thinking-Create-Change-Changing/dp/1933820462]:\n\n> The obvious is not obvious. It is constructed. We work together, as individuals\nand in groups, to construct the obvious every day. We band together in “obvious\nclubs” that defend competing versions of reality. When you walk into your\nobvious club, you will find people reading the same books, watching the same\nnews channels, and talking to the same people, all of which tends to reinforce\nthe same version of reality.\n\n\nThe idea of reality as a construct is not new. We filter our world through a\nlense, one made up of our experiences and beliefs. But the idea of a mutually\nconstructed obvious – what one might call common sense – rather than an\ninherited or inherent one, is a new framing for me.\n\nAnd this rings especially true as I think back on my many conversations about\nthis election. So many of which were kicked off by the realisation we had read\nthe same article or listened to the same podcast. It wasn’t just that my friends\nand I arrived at the election from the same place – as outsiders looking in. We\nwere searching for bricks and gluing them together in our conversations.\n\n> If you think something is obvious, that’s an idea that bears closer examination.\nWhy do you think it’s obvious? What personal experiences have you had that led\nto that belief? Can you imagine a different set of experiences that might lead\nto a different belief?\n\n\nThere’s a whole bunch of people taking a hard look at their priors right now,\ntalking about breaking outside their bubbles. This is where you should start.\nThere is no inherent obvious.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2016-11-12T15:00:27.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:07:56.000Z","published_at":"2016-11-12T15:00:27.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb116","uuid":"9edef48a-0b8b-4568-a1bb-4b5fd5db0296","title":"The world doesn't fit in neat boxes","slug":"the-world-doesnt-fit-in-neat-boxes","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>So I wanted to add to <a href=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/nothing-is-obvious/\\\">something I just wrote about</a> – the construction of our realities.

I’ve alternately been calling it a\nseries of economic biographies, and a sweeping history of political economy. The\nblurb refers to it as a \"survey\" of the characters that shaped economics.\n\nI’m not sure any of these really get at what makes it so wonderful.\n\nNasar, who previously wrote A Beautiful Mind (which is not only a great movie\nbut a fantastic book\n[https://www.bookdepository.com/Beautiful-Mind-Sylvi-Nasar/9780571212927/?a_aid=thambili]\n), has weaved together both the lives and ideas of the giants of economics. From\nMalthus and Riccardo, right up to Amartya Sen.\n\nThe first third of the book is straight up biography. Of Marx, Marshall, Webb,\nFisher and Schumpter. Each chapter it’s own little world.\n\nNasar beautifully builds a story of progress, of theory and worldview. From a\nworld of harsh limits to entrepreneurial magic, from zero to positive sum, and\nback, from theories that resembled simple mechanics, to intricate and complex\nbiology.\n\nBut it’s the little vignettes of their lives that really make the book pop.\n\n> \"Marx never did step outside. He never bothered to learn English well. His world\nwas restricted to a small circle of like-minded émigrés. His contacts with\nEnglish working-class leaders were superficial. He never exposed his ideas to\npeople who could challenge him on equal terms. His interaction with economists…\nwhose ideas he wished to demolish, was nonexistent… Astonishglingly for the best\nfriend of a factory owner and the author of some of the mos impassioned\ndescriptions of mechanization’s horrors, Marx never visited a single English\nfactory – or any factory at all until he went on a guided tour of a porcelain\nfactory near Carlsbad, where he took the waters toward the end of his life.\"\n\n\nThese little glimpses, the events that shaped their focus and reactions, really\nground ideas that often feel abstract. They explain the blind spots and short\nsightedness that can be maddening in retrospect. These were people, not robots,\nwhose theories and ideas were born out of lived experience and necessity.\n\n> \"From the age of eight, he commuted daily by omnibus, ferry, and foot through\nthe most noxious manufacturing districts and slums bordering the Thames.\nMarshall had been looking into the faces of poor people all his life.\"\n\n\nAnother thing you can’t fail but notice is the sheer fortune. That, until Sen,\nthey were exclusively white. And almost all were either independently wealthy or\nmarried into it.\n\n> \"Beatrice’s identity was shaped by having been born into Britain’s \"new ruling\nclass,\" and her mind by having been \"brought up in the midst of the capitalist\nspeculation\" and \"the restless spirit of big enterprise.\" As the historian\nBarbara Cain notes, Beatrice distinguished her class not by wealth but by the\nfact that it was \"a class of persons who habitually gave orders, but who seldom,\nif ever, executed the orders of other people.\"\n\n\nIn the second and third parts of the book, the narrative switches. Rather than\ncharacters in self-contained chapters, the story hinges on the big events of the\n20th century – the world wars, the depression, the rise of international\ninstitutions and decolonialism. Characters weave in and out of the narrative,\nbased on their links, intellectual and personal, to events and each other.\n\n> \"World War 1 destroyed globalisation, disrupted economic growth, severed\nphysical, financial, and trade links, bankrupted governments and businesses, and\nled weak or populist regimes to rely on desperate measures that were supposed to\nhead off revolutions but just as often hastened them. When the war was over, the\nvictors as well as the vanquished were crippled by colossal debts and subjected\nto vicious attacks of inflation and deflation.\"\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop some of the magic and mystery of their ideas disappears.\nJoseph Schumpeter, for instance, is widely lauded nowadays for \"creative\ndestruction\" and an emphasis on entrepreneurialism. But this seems less like a\nflight of genius and more a position of necessity when you consider he was the\nAustrian finance minister in 1919.\n\nThe country had been devastated by war, stripped of empire, and was faced with a\nblockade and dwindling reserves. With few resources at his command, it’s\nunderstandable Schumpeter put his faith in an X factor.\n\n> \"[Schumpeter] believed that a shrunken Austria had the means to recover\neconomically. His deepest conviction was that nations’ resources matter less\nthan what they did with what they had. As long as entrepreneurs were allowed to\ncreate new enterprises, the financial system was functioning efficiently, and\nthere were not too many barriers to trade, society could regenerate itself. He\nrejected the popular assumption that economic viability depended on vast\nterritories, huge populations, and natural resources.\"\n\n\nOf course the elephant in the room here is Keynes. But he, too, gets brought\nback to earth with stories.\n\n> \"For most of his twenties, Keynes was Britain’s resident expert on obscure\ncurrencies. Thinking about currencies got him into the habit of thinking about\neconomies holistically instead of focusing on \"trade\" or \"labor\" or \"industry\"\nin isolation, and taught him how to draw salient conclusions from a handful of\nindicators. It also gave him a feeling for which government actions exerted\nsystemic effects, like those of the moon on tides, instead of effects on a\nparticular industry or group.\n\n\nNone of this should take away from their brilliance. But it’s refreshing to get\naway from economics as received wisdom, or mathematical laws of nature, and into\na world of messy identity and politics.

And it’s\nbacked up by numerous examples, including that we are willing to cop inequality\nwhen the cause is chance.\n\n> \"We suggest that the perception that there is a preference for equality arises\nthrough an undue focus on special circumstances, often studied in the\nlaboratory, where inequality and unfairness coincide. In most situations,\nhowever, including those involving real world distributions of wealth, people’s\nconcerns about fairness lead them to favour unequal distributions.\"\n\n\nIt seems that what really triggers us is the process, not the outcomes.\n\n> \"It follows, then, that if one believes that (a) people in the real world\nexhibit variation in effort, ability, moral deservingness, and so on, and (b) a\nfair system takes these considerations into account, then a preference for\nfairness will dictate that one should prefer unequal outcomes in actual\nsocieties.\"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-05-28T12:02:41.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:07:20.000Z","published_at":"2017-05-28T12:02:41.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb11f","uuid":"3b17d1e1-78bc-4734-b9aa-f27633761dd5","title":"Mozart was a village","slug":"mozart-was-a-village","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>It&#8217;s hard to fathom the mind of a genius.

Progress – especially of the technological kind – is very rarely as\nradical as we think.\n\nWhen I think about all the hype surrounding the blockchain\n[https://theconversation.com/whats-holding-up-the-blockchain-79038], I start to\nthink of all the other technologies that have been used as immutable ledgers.\n\nThe tally\n[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6281.1975.tb00042.x/abstract] \n– a wooden stick used to keep track of financial transactions – is a perfect\nexample.\n\n> The sum involved in a transaction was represented by notches in a stick of wood,\nwhich was then split to furnish both payee and payor with tangible and\ntamper-proof evidence of the event. Although often inscribed with symbols to\nidentify the measuring unit or to give other information about the transaction,\nthe basic data in the form of different width notches, was understood by both\nthe literate and the illiterate. This feature invites speculation that the use\nof the tally may have predated written communication.\n\n\nThe exact grain of the wood in each tally is different, meaning they are all but\nimpossible to forge. The tally essentially achieved with nature something the\nblockchain does through an encrypted public ledger.\n\nAccording to Willard Stone\n[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6281.1975.tb00042.x/abstract]\n, the tally may go back as far as the ancient Greeks. Maybe even to 484BC.\n\n> Herodotus tells of a Greek from Miletus, because of the insecure conditions in\nIonia, giving half his fortune to Glaucus, a Spartan known for his honesty,\ntogether with tallies… Many years had gone by when the sons of the man by whom\nthe money was left came to Sparta, and had an interview with Glaucus, whereat\nthey produced the tallies, and asked to have the money returned to them.\n\n\nFrom there the tally pops up all over the world and throughout history. Marco\nPolo described their use as IOUs in China. French monasteries used them to keep\ntrack of deposits. The British exchequer used tallies both to keep track of\ntaxes paid, as well as what was lost during currency debasement.\n\n> When the Bank of England was foundedin 1694, one of its first acts was to make a\nloan of ~€1,200,000 to the Government. Acknowledgement of the debt was in the\nform of tallies, the longest of which exceeds eight feet in length (these are\nstill in existence and unredeemed).\n\n\nThis isn’t to say that the blockchain isn’t a spectacular achievement. It very\nmuch is. But we should recognise that a lot of today’s financial technologies\naren’t solving unsolved problems. They are just more efficient ways of doing\nwhat we already do.\n\nWe may be seeing an unprecedented technological boom. But most of our problems\naren’t new and we’ve been using technology to solve them since year dot.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-09-17T00:55:51.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:06:58.000Z","published_at":"2017-09-17T00:55:51.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb126","uuid":"b0de809f-2764-4bdb-b141-9d37f62dbf12","title":"The diminishing returns of research","slug":"the-diminishing-returns-of-research","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>&quot;Innovation&quot; has become a political/economic <a href=\\\"https://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda\\\">panacea</a> over the past few years.

It was, at the very least, rude, and quite\npossibly sneaky or creepy or something. Besides, as the phone rang, there were\nalways so many questions, so many things to sort out. Who was it? What did they\nwant? Was it for … me?”\n\n\nThis is an interesting piece [https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/561545] by\nAlexis C. Madrigal on the demise of phone calls. But I don’t think he does\nenough to drive home the shift that has taken place.\n\nPhone calls are an especially violent form of communication. This is in part\nbecause they are strictly synchronous – all participants have to take part at\nthe same time – but also because a ringing telephone is incredibly distracting.\n\nUnless it has been scheduled beforehand, a phone call by definition places the\ncaller’s needs above the recipient. Without the screening technology of newer\nforms of communication, anyone with your number can impose their consciousness\nonto yours.\n\nEven if you don’t answer. No matter what you are doing.\n\nBut the plethora of asynchronous communications methods – text messages, email,\nsocial media etc. – means the bar to phone calls is now higher. Or at least it\nshould be.\n\nIf it isn’t life or death, or you don’t need an answer five minutes ago, then\ndon’t call me. There are plenty of ways to communicate that don’t prioritise one\nperson above another.\n\nCalling when it isn’t necessary is, in fact, quite rude.\n\n> “No one picks up the phone anymore. Even many businesses do everything they can\nto avoid picking up the phone… There are many reasons for the slow erosion of\nthis commons. The most important aspect is structural: There are simply more\ncommunication options.”\n\n\nUnfortunately, society hasn’t quite caught up to this new norm.

A group of analysts tore apart a Tesla 3 and were impressed by the technology,\nbut found the execution lacking.\n\nThis is a really common narrative out of Silicon Valley. It’s a place that lauds\n“naive innovation” – that an outsider can come up with solutions the experts\njust overlook.\n\n> “Munro found that Tesla reduced the amount of wiring snaking through the car by\nconcentrating a lot of the electronics in small circuit boards. That’s knowledge\nfrom Silicon Valley that the carmakers don’t have. The trick now is turning this\nestablished technological advantage into consistent profits—and to do that Musk \nneeds to hire executives with experience in the nuts and bolts of carmaking…”\n\n\nIn some respects naive innovation has served Silicon Valley well. SpaceX is a \nperfect example [https://www.space.com/31420-spacex-rocket-landing-success.html]\n. But it can discount valuable experience.\n\nMy favourite is this interview\n[https://pando.com/2012/11/08/daniel-eks-impossible-thinking-started-at-age-13-with-a-web-development-mini-empire/] \nwith Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek:\n\n> When Google turned him down for a job, he thought, “I’ll just make my own search\nengine, it can’t be that hard,” he said. “It turns out it’s really, really hard.\n”\n\n\nIt also reminds me of many anecdotes in Bad Blood\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood], the story of biotech\nstartup Theranos. The founder of which has since been indicted for fraud\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html]\n.\n\nTheranos aimed and claimed to have invented a device that could do myriad blood\ntests on just a drop of blood. But there’s a reason the many well-capitalised\nand incentivised biotech companies had failed.\n\nFrom Bad Blood:\n\n> “The ability to perform so many tests on just a drop or two of blood was\nsomething of a Holy Grail in the field of microfluidics. Thousands of\nresearchers around the world in universities and industry had been pursuing this\ngoal for more than two decades…”\n\n\n\n\n> “Had Steve Burd been allowed inside the East Meadow Circle lab, a network of\nrooms located in the center of the low-slung building, he would have noticed\nthat it didn’t contain a single Theranos proprietary device.

Part of this\nis undoubtedly my fault. I wasn’t a great, or really even that interested in\nbeing, a student until midway through university. But there’s also something a\nbit broken in how we approach maths. Both in school and life generally. \n\nI’m talking about maths as a purely abstract phenomena. A series of formulas and\nsteps, divorced from how they relate to the real world. Where multiplication is\na table to be memorised and trigonometry takes place purely within a textbook. \n\nThis kind of mathematics not only strips away a lot of the beauty and joy, but\nrelegates the subject to one only grasped by those who excel in a particular\nsystem. It turns maths into something like an ecclesiastical language, almost\nscary to the unindoctrinated. \n\nThis is a shame, really, as Lara Alcock writes in Mathematics Rebooted\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35628047-mathematics-rebooted]:\n\n> “…mathematical thinking is not magical. It is often thought of that way in our\nculture, where it is common to have a demanding career or to run a happy and\nsuccessful household, yet to say, ‘Oh, I am terrible at maths.’ I hear this a\nlot, and every time it is clear to me that it cannot really be true: this person\nis obviously a capable thinker. ”\n\n\nTo some extent abstraction is necessary in schools as currently constituted.\nStudents must be judged against something objective, and must be taught at\nscale. But does this really require so much concentration on the doctrine, to\nthe detriment of the art? \n\nWhy is maths largely rote, rather than logic? Abstract rather than practical?\n\n> “Your mathematical knowledge might be rusty and full of holes, but people who\ncan function well in our complicated world must be good general thinkers, and \nmathematics is just general thinking about abstract concepts.”\n\n\nWhen you read about the likes of Newton and Galileo, maths jumps out as a tool\nfor problem solving and creativity. In The Triumph of Numbers\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301160.The_Triumph_of_Numbers?from_search=true]\n, I. Bernard Cohen explores how numbers and maths have evolved over time, and\ndescribes a plethora of interesting applications.\n\nIncluding the algebra of morality:\n\n> “[Francis Hutcheson\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)]] used this\nalgebraic relationship to translate several commonsense notions about morality\ninto mathematical language. The first is that if two people have the same\nnatural ability to do good (A), the one who produces more public good (M) is\nmore benevolent (B). Conversely, if two people produce the same amount of public\ngood, the one with more ability is less benevolent (since it was in that\nperson’s ability to do more). The plus/minus sign in the equation allowed\nHutcheson to factor in self-interest.”\n\n\n\n\n> “…he concluded from his algebra that “in equal Numbers, the Virtue is as the\nQuantity of the Happiness, or natural Good.” That is, he taught that “Virtue is\nin a compound Ratio of the Quantity of Good, and Number of Enjoyers.” This led\nhim to the important conclusion that “that Action is best, which accomplishes\nthe greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers.” Here is a precursor, by more\nthan 50 years, to Jeremy Bentham’s (1748–1832) utilitarian philosophy of “the\ngreatest happiness for the greatest number.”\n\n\nThis is a maths of reasoning and personal application. He wasn’t trying to\ncalculate the change from a $20 or the tensile strength of a beam. \n\nSimilarly, in The Calculus Story\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34757446-the-calculus-story?from_search=true]\n, David Acheson produces probably the best explanation of how to calculate the\narea of a circle, by imagining a polygon with more and more sides (I think I\nfinally understand pi r squared). \n\nAs you might be able to tell, I’ve been reading a fair amount of maths books\nrecently, and the thing that strikes me is how differently mathematicians\napproach the subject than how I was taught in school. \n\nMathematicians work through subjects largely by reasoning and logic, not\nnecessarily ever more complicated formulae. They also emphasise the problem\nsolving nature of maths, often tasking you to think about a problem and come up\nwith your own generally applicable rule.\n\nPutting this into practice, I have also been studying maths using Brilliant.Org\n[https://brilliant.org], which has a similar philosophy\n[https://brilliant.org/principles/]:\n\n> “In school, people are often trained to apply formulas to rote problems. But\nthis traditional approach prevents deeper understanding of concepts, reduces\nindependent critical thinking, and cultivates few useful skills…The capacity to\nthink critically separates the great from the good. We can grow this capacity by\ntrying — and often failing — to solve diverse, concrete problems.”\n\n\nI have only finished one module on Brilliant and I’m not sure how it will work\nas a method for the masses. But I will report back in a couple of months. \n\nIn the mean time, I’ll leave you with Lara Alcock again, whose book\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35628047-mathematics-rebooted] I really\nrecommend:\n\n> “School mathematics tends to come in horizontal slices: children learn basic\nideas about several topics, then, the next year, they learn slightly more\nadvanced ideas about those topics, and so on. This is entirely sensible. But it\nmeans that the vertical links are not very salient, which is important because\nmathematics can be seen as a highly interconnected network in which more\nsophisticated ideas build upon more basic ones. So this book’s approach is to\nfocus explicitly on the vertical links.

I naively stumbled into coding assuming all I needed were the terms and grammar of a knew &#8220;language&#8221;. But there&#8217;s so much more to learn for someone who has mostly had a liberal arts education.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s a completely different mode of thinking. You often see coding/development described as &#8220;problem solving&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think that is quite acurate. I have been bumbling my way through a kind of alien logic.</p>\\n<p>Actually, the best example comes from a recent problem I encountered on <a href=\\\"https://brilliant.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Brilliant</a>:</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Define a comparison as an operation which takes in one number and tells you whether it is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, another. Suppose you are given a sorted array with 1000 elements, and you can use at most n comparisons to determine whether a certain number is in this array.&nbsp;<strong>What is the smallest value</strong> of n such that you will always be capable of making this determination, regardless of the values of the elements in the array?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Essentially what they are asking me to do is conjure up a number and find that same number in a&nbsp;<em>sorted</em> list of 1000 numbers. What&#8217;s the smallest number of comparisons I would need to make to find the match? I sat stumped for quite a while with this problem.</p>\\n<p>Eventually I gave up. I couldn&#8217;t fathom how to even approach it. &nbsp;Having now seen <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">the solution</a> I can&#8217;t imagine I would ever have arrived there through deduction alone. It wasn&#8217;t so much a lack of knowledge of terms etc., my regular heuristics simply don&#8217;t apply.</p>\\n<p>Another example comes from a book called <a href=\\\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-software-works-the-magic-behind-encryption-cgi-search-engines-and-other-everyday-technologies/oclc/899229274&#038;referer=brief_results\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">How Software Works</a>, which I am currently working my way through. This is from a chapter on protecting passwords:</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Authentication systems need a way to strengthen hashing without a performance-crushing number of hash iterations; that is, they need a method of storing passwords that requires an impractical time investment from attackers without creating an equally unrealistic time burden on legitimate access. That method is called salt&#8230; <strong>The salt is a string of characters, like a short, random password, that is combined with the user’s password before hashing.</strong> For example, user mrgutman chooses falcon as his password, and the system generates h38T2 as the salt&#8230;.</p>\\n<p>The salt and password can be combined in various ways, but the simplest is <strong>appending the salt to the end of the password</strong>, resulting in falconh38T2 in this example. <strong>This combination is then hashed</strong>, and the hash code stored in the authentication table along with the username and the salt&#8230;</p>\\n<p>If there are, say, 100,000 users in a stolen authentication table, and the salts are numerous enough that no salt is duplicated in the table, the attacker will need to create 100,000 tables. At this point, we can’t even call them precomputed tables <strong>because the attacker is creating them for each attack.</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Buried in a section about scrambling (<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">not the right word I know</a>) passwords so that they cannot be reverse engineererd and easily matched, we have this interesting solution. Simply append a random string to the password before scrambling. Put this way it&#8217;s quite simple and I can follow the logic.

It now seems like they did know about climate change long ago\n[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings]\n, but were those executives really sitting in front of a fireplace stroking a\nwhite cat?\n\nIt seems like it would be more useful, maybe even more accurate, to view them as\nexactly like the rest of us. We all want to be the heroes of our own stories.\nNone of us want to be wrong. We all dig in, especially given perverse\nincentives.\n\nWe all engage in motivated reasoning, among other scary mental shortcuts and\nfallibilities [__GHOST_URL__/time-to-update-our-democratic-models/].\n\nRather than treating them as deviant or Machiavellian, surely it’s healthier to\nrealise many of us would react the same given a similar position? At the very\nleast it won’t shut down the conversation.\n\nOnce someone in the conversation is evil there is very little room to move –\nlook at contemporary political discourse. Everyone wants to be the hero. That’s\nthe only way we get anywhere.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-02-16T22:44:56.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:04:18.000Z","published_at":"2019-02-16T22:44:56.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb155","uuid":"62ec8b74-ce33-4b62-9fdf-453a5e8a45a1","title":"What are school tests trying to measure?","slug":"what-are-school-tests-trying-to-measure","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>I&#8217;ve just started reading <a href=\\\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/lady-tasting-tea-how-statistics-revolutionized-science-in-the-twentieth-century/oclc/872608492&#038;referer=brief_results\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">The Lady Tasting Tea</a>, the story of statistics in/and modern science.

We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased\nperceptions of discrimination and that it reduces assimilation by casting\nreligion and national identities as incompatible.\n\n\nThis is from a recent working paper\n[https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/abdelgadirfoukajan2019.pdf] \nlooking at a 2004 French law that banned “religious signs” in primary and\nsecondary schools. It affected many religions, but was essentially a de facto\nban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in school.\n\nThese bans are purportedly to encourage assimilation and a homogenisation of\nvalues. But study authors Aala Abdelgadir and Vasiliki Fouka find that it can\nactually intensify a minority sense of identity.\n\nWhich makes sense. I’m struggling to think of a ban on anything that actually\nchanged minds. Some part of the population will follow the decree because they\nbelieve in it already. Others will stomach it. And the rest will contravene and\nreap the consequences/rewards.\n\nIn cases like murder, the benefits of a ban outweigh the consequences for the\nindividual. For some drugs, the tide seems to be shifting in the other\ndirection.\n\nBut do the benefits of forced cultural homogenisation really outweigh the\nconsequences for these women and their families? Especially given they could\nrebound for generations?\n\n> We measure educational and socioeconomic outcomes of French-born women with\nparents from Muslim-majority countries who were just old enough to have been at\nschool when the law was enacted, and compare them to older cohorts who did not\nexperience the ban, and to a variety of control groups, including non-Muslim\nimmigrants and Muslim men.\n\n\n> Our ﬁrst ﬁnding is that exposure to the ban signiﬁcantly reduces the likelihood\nof completing secondary education. Part of this eﬀect appears to be driven by a\nnegative impact on enrollment rates in secondary school for Muslim women aged 16\nand above… We also ﬁnd that Muslim women aﬀected by the ban took longer to\ncomplete secondary education, conditional on their pre-existing age-educational\nproﬁles. These higher dropout rates and longer completion times indicate that\nthe ban disrupted the educational progress of Muslim girls. This negative\neducational shock carries over to a number of longer term outcomes, such as\nlabor force participation, employment rates, and fertility patterns.\n\n\nThese women and families were wearing scarves for a legitimate reason to them.\nThat a top-down approach is destined to fail is driven home by the mechanism by\nwhich this all occurred:\n\n> We show that these longer run eﬀects of the ban work through two hypothesized\npathways: a discrimination channel, and an identity channel. First, women\naﬀected by the ban report increased perceptions of discrimination at school and\na lower trust in the French school system… Second.. Muslim women were forced to \nchoose between a secular French identity and attachment to their religious\npractices, a conﬂict that often led to alienation from the French society. In\nthe data, Muslim women aﬀected by the ban increase their identiﬁcation with the\nnationality of their father relatively more than their identiﬁcation with\nFrance.\n\n\nAs always my emphasis.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-03-01T14:25:17.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:03:48.000Z","published_at":"2019-03-01T14:25:17.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb15d","uuid":"020ee988-f060-4dbe-8f52-3577de461db7","title":"Banning German doesn't help either","slug":"banning-german-doesnt-help-either","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>As a coda to the <a href=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/what-happens-when-you-ban-headscarves/\\\">last post</a> about banning headscarves, Vasiliki Fouka has <a href=\\\"https://vfouka.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4871/f/backlashjan2019.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">another working paper</a> looking at the impact of US schools banning German as a language of instruction after World War One:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Aﬀected individuals were less likely to volunteer in WWII and more likely to marry within their ethnic group and to choose decidedly German names for their oﬀspring.

How language and culture\nboth inform and limit what we can take in [__GHOST_URL__/why-the-west/]. And\nthat much appears to be stuck in formative states\n[__GHOST_URL__/why-are-we-not-keeping-up/].\n\nBut twice this week I’ve come across arguments that our “beliefs” are actually\nso transitory and shallow that they are all but meaningless.\n\nThat we are so riven with contradictions and so lacking a coherent world view\nthat our “beliefs” are little more than fleeting notions backed up by post hoc\nrationing.\n\nFirst in an old New Yorker article\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds] \nthat makes me seriously question\n[https://annotations.joshnicholas.com/2019/04/10/fact-checking-is.html] ever\nagain trying to change someone’s mind.\n\nAnd now in my continued [__GHOST_URL__/singles-not-home-runs/] reading of The\nHidden Half\n[https://www.worldcat.org/title/hidden-half-how-the-world-conceals-its-secrets/oclc/1085142484&referer=brief_results]\n:\n\n> We asked our volunteers to choose their political priorities on a scale of 1 to\n10. For example, what would you do if it came to a choice whether the country\nshould spend more on state-provided healthcare, or spend less and cut taxes\n(where 1 was definitely spend more and 10 was definitely cut tax)?…A short while\nlater, we went back to talk over with our volunteers what they’d written and\nwhy. But we cheated. We left their original answer sheet as it was–written in\ntheir own hand with their names at the top to help convince them nothing fishy\nwas going on. But where their answers were anywhere from 3 to 7–so not a\ndefinite 1 or a definite, uncompromising 10–we flipped the question around.\n\n\nThese are quite long quotes, but bear with me.\n\n> The partially handwritten page in front of them was evidence of what they\nbelieved–or so they thought. And it was this (doctored) opinion that they now\ndefended. I sat down with a man who originally said that tax cuts were more\nimportant than more spending on state healthcare–and listened as he now\nexplained why the opposite was true. His explanation was earnest, intelligent,\nclear, without hesitation. He wasn’t confused. He accepted this new position as\na legitimate summary of his beliefs and didn’t miss a beat in justifying them.\n\n\nI’ve read of studies where people surrender their opinion in the face of a\nmajority or authority figure.\n\nBut that we are so intellectually supplicant that an unrecorded belief is\nessentially meaningless has quite thrown me. And that we could be dictated to by\na recorded belief – even a false one – even more so.\n\nTo a certain extent this merely lines up with previous arguments in the book\nabout complexity and simplification. But the lack of stability in the “lens” we\nuse to understand the world – that I can’t feed you similar information over and\nover and expect a somewhat predictable response – has huge implications for\ndiscourse and institutions.\n\nLet me end with a concluding remark from this section of the book:\n\n> …the ideal of holding a complete picture in our heads damns our capabilities\nwith an impossible aspiration.

Legions of authorities\ncloaked in total conviction tell us why we should invade country X, ban The\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn in schools, or eat stewed tomatoes; how much\nbrain damage is necessary to justify a plea of diminished capacity; the precise\nmoment when a sperm and an egg must be treated as a human being; and why the\nstock market will eventually revert to historical returns. A public change of\nmind is national news.\n\n\nThis is the first paragraph from On Being Certain\n[https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-being-certain-believing-you-are-right-even-when-youre-not/oclc/316509656&referer=brief_results] \nby Robert A. Burton. I am just a couple of pages in, but this has stopped me\nshort.\n\nThe book is ostensibly about the biological origins of the feeling of knowing.\nHow it is separate from “reason” and logic. But this paragraph perfectly\nencapsulates how the way society frames issues ignores and even rewards\nunwarranted certainty.\n\nModern media has an endemic sense of certainty. Journalistic convention is based\non an underlying assumption of causation, of the world in front of us as the\ndirect result of something that can be tracked down and explained. Something\nhappened so there must be someone to talk to, or a bang that preceded it.\n\nThere’s no way it’s unknowable, or the result of complex interactions we can\nonly tease out with time and after making many assumptions. Dogged by problems\nof measurement and perception. As a result you get a lot of declarative\nstatements, black and white.\n\nWhen a professional athlete is doing well, for instance, we are furnished with\nstories of their extensive workouts. When they do poorly we hear about their\ntroubled childhood and off-court issues. Or maybe they just suck now. There’s\nlittle room for underlying randomness, problematic measurements, statistical\nnoise and mean reversion. A cause must be found and responsibility taken.\n\nThe issue here is the need for a narrative. As a journalist, narrative is an\nimportant tool for grabbing someone’s attention, keeping it, and guiding them\nthrough a larger point. Or to highlight something specific and make it\nmemorable.\n\nBut what does a narrative need? In this context it almost always entails\nsimplistic cause and effect.\n\nAt the end of many news bulletins we get a financial update. We hear how this\ncurrency rose, a stockmarket over there fell, after hours trading is stagnant\netc. All fair enough, except that they’re often immediately tied to a news hook.\n\nThe Yen went down cause a Yeti was spotted in Turkey. The Nasdaq rose cause\nDutch tulips were especially vibrant this year. Sunspots.\n\nNarrative is useful for audiences to connect with this kind of abstraction. But\nthere’s no way causation for activities this complex were nailed down in the\ntime between the signal and the news piece, if they ever can be.\n\nThese triggers often are big enough to have some association, but how much? How\nthat was figured out is honestly an even better story.\n\nThat last line from Burton, about a change of mind being national news is also\ndeserving of unpicking.\n\nIt is fair enough that leaders changing their minds about something is news. But\nthe problem is in how it is approached. How often is the story about the change\nitself rather than what underlay the previous “belief” and how that changed? How\ngood is the information, or, if that hasn’t changed, the mental model that\nreinterpreted it?\n\nBeliefs often aren’t a binary proposition, especially when it comes to policy.\nRather, they are about juggling trade offs, dogged by information asymmetries\nand stretched resources (mental and otherwise).\n\nBut here I am also falling into the trap of beliefs as the function of logic and\nreason. As I’ve documented here\n[__GHOST_URL__/where-does-your-belief-come-from/], beliefs have many potential\nfathers. Perhaps biology is one.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-05-16T17:13:09.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T13:14:31.000Z","published_at":"2019-05-16T17:13:09.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb19d","uuid":"95b1207f-e79d-466e-94ea-1944b5b6402d","title":"Making

He’s the “father of information theory”,\nwithout which much of the modern world wouldn’t be.\n\nShannon reminds me of stories about Richard Feynman. Bursting with curiosity,\nyes, but also sparked with joy at tinkering with knowledge.\n\nI sometimes feel like this is lost in a world where education is sold as\npreparation for employment rather than rounding someone out or living a\nfulfilled life.\n\nOn Shannon:\n\n> “His was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play; he was that rare\nscientific genius who was just as content rigging up a juggling robot or a\nflamethrowing trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits. He worked with\nlevity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the\ntwo. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself.\nAnd the marks of his playful mind—the mind that wondered how a box of electric\nswitches could mimic a brain, and the mind that asked why no one ever decides to\nsay “XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ”—are imprinted on all of his deepest insights”\n\n\nAnd here’s a little vignette from Surely You’re Joking Mr Feynman\n[https://www.worldcat.org/title/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character/oclc/1022267511&referer=brief_results]\n, one of my favourite books:\n\n> “…I laid out a lot of glass microscope slides, and got the ants to walk on them,\nback and forth, to some sugar I put on the windowsill. Then, by replacing an old\nslide with a new one, or by rearranging the slides, I could demonstrate that the\nants had no sense of geometry: they couldn’t figure out where something was. If\nthey went to the sugar one way, and there was a shorter way back, they would\nnever figure out the short way. It was also pretty clear from rearranging the\nglass slides that the ants left some sort of trail…”\n\n\nNot only is this Feynman as a child luxuriating in experimentation and learning\nfor its own sake, but also him repeating the story years later. Despite a dismal\ncareer as an myrmecologist, that’s how important and formative he thought\nexperiences like this were.\n\nPutting aside personal fulfilment, I wonder how successful Feynman and Shannon\nwould have been had they not “wasted” time building up other adjacent stores of\nknowledge.\n\nEspecially considering how successful they were at bringing new perspectives and\nslants to established ideas.\n\nAs always my

Dai was asked, for a Kaggle blog post, how important\ndomain expertise is for winning competitions. “To be frank, I don’t think we can\nbenefit from domain expertise too much… It’s very hard to win a competition just\nby using [well-known] methods,” he replied. “We need more creative solutions.””\n\n\nThis is referring to Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com], a site I haven’t yet found\nthe bravery to crack with my new coding skills 😅\n\nAnyway, it comes amid an exploration of problem solving, and how experts can be\ntrapped by their domain knowledge, falling back into familiar patterns that\nhaven’t worked. Meanwhile the answer, as in the case of some of these kaggle\ncompetitions, ie often from somewhere else completely.\n\n> ““The people who win a Kaggle health competition have no medical training, no\nbiology training, and they’re also often not real machine learning experts,”\nPedro Domingos, a computer science professor and machine learning researcher,\ntold me. “Knowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things,\nbut it also makes you blind to other things that you could do.””\n\n\nAs always my

The\nalgorithmization of counterfactuals invites thinking machines to benefit from\nthis ability and participate in this (until now) uniquely human way of thinking\nabout the world.\n\n\nI came across these sections in the early parts of The Book of Why\n[https://www.worldcat.org/title/book-of-why-the-new-science-of-cause-and-effect/oclc/1106172917&referer=brief_results] \nby Judea Pearl. It’s a book on the science of causality. Here he’s exploring\nsome of the differences between humans and the current crop of “thinking\nmachines” – artificial intelligence and other algorithmic “learning” from data.\n\nI’ve always loved counterfactuals as a rhetorical device, sort of a stripped\ndown model. We can play with what if’s and construct something together. Try to\ntease out causality and significance, however elementary.\n\nBut it’s interesting to consider this as a driver of human evolution. As a\nmethodology for iteration that doesn’t appear to be possessed by other animals\nor modern computer models.\n\n> Within 10,000 years after the Lion Man’s creation, all other hominids (except\nfor the very geographically isolated Flores hominids) had become extinct. And\nhumans have continued to change the natural world with incredible speed, using\nour imagination to survive, adapt, and ultimately take over. The advantage we\ngained from imagining counterfactuals was the same then as it is today:\nflexibility, the ability to reflect and improve on past actions, and, perhaps\neven more significant, our willingness to take responsibility for past and\ncurrent actions…\n\n\nMany of us have a tendency to favour the concrete and eschew the hypothetical.\nBut risk aversion, imagination and learning from experience – among other\ndrivers of progress – by necessity recognise the possibility of other outcomes.\nThey are built on counterfactual thinking.\n\nAnd, maybe more interestingly when we compare human intelligence to that which\nwe try to create, it may be somewhat innate?\n\n> …Counterfactual reasoning, which deals with what-ifs, might strike some readers\nas unscientific. Indeed, empirical observation can never confirm or refute the\nanswers to such questions. Yet our minds make very reliable and reproducible\njudgments all the time about what might be or might have been. We all\nunderstand, for instance, that had the rooster been silent this morning, the sun\nwould have risen just as well. This consensus stems from the fact that \ncounterfactuals are not products of whimsy but reflect the very structure of our\nworld model.\n\n\nAs always my emphasis","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-11-26T09:55:06.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T12:31:15.000Z","published_at":"2019-11-26T09:55:06.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb2b6","uuid":"6468d99f-5fc5-465b-acf0-36fc11fb8e50","title":"What are the truly difficult questions?","slug":"what-are-the-truly-difficult-questions","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>A couple of years ago I went on a three day trek that all but shattered my love of hikes.

Such as that\nwithout initial capital reallocation, the removal of certain property rights\ncould lead to more inequality. Or that many people desperately need the\nstability afforded them by property ownership.\n\nBut I really like this argument that we need to consider the idea within context\nrather than turning it into a straw man. We need to think of them as mechanisms\nthat could be strategically employed, within an established political economy.\n\nEspecially as our discourse has sped up, as more diverse voices added, it is\ntempting to summarily dismiss new ideas because they aren’t perfect. Because\nthere are negative consequences that hadn’t been considered.\n\nI like Ryan Avent’s reading of Radical Markets\n[https://medium.com/@ryanavent_93844/a-brief-ish-review-of-radical-markets-6454ba0637a8] \nas a work of political philosophy. On the need to consider radical solutions to\nbig problems. As an appeal to consider market mechanisms in areas that we\ncurrently don’t.\n\nAgain from Buterin and Jaron Lanier:\n\n> Abstractions can play out differently according to context. Any mechanism can be\nturned into an instrument of violence if it is overly amplified and drowns out\nevery other process in a society. And yet without better mechanisms, we are\ndoomed to stumble around, failing to address the complexities of our times.\n\n\nNone of the rules in society are natural. They’ve all been contrived. The\nquestions are why and by whom. Injecting markets into more areas of society may\nmake sense. Or maybe the inverse.\n\nNew ideas may not suit as panaceas, but do right in specific situations or after\nsome adaptation. Perhaps it’s time for something more targeted.\n\nAs always my emphasis","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-12-23T11:57:03.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T12:30:35.000Z","published_at":"2019-12-23T11:57:03.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb2f9","uuid":"71c73c53-be5f-419b-8a99-b43ab2a31f91","title":"Christmas markets","slug":"christmas-markets","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg\",\"width\":3688,\"height\":2543}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1379\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/69Christmasmarkets2.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure>","comment_id":"3489","plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-12-26T20:10:08.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T23:53:34.000Z","published_at":"2019-12-26T20:10:08.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb2fc","uuid":"c23ccc2a-0023-4df2-92d9-50c272f46a55","title":"Bring on the cyborgs","slug":"bring-on-the-cyborgs","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>One of the most interesting observations in <a href=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/no-solution-is-perfect/\\\">Radical Markets</a> is that artificial intelligence is (at least currently) beholden to the labour of humans.

This\nmay seem like a simplistic and obvious point, but we often take for granted what\nprotections are afforded to certain assets, why some stakeholders are held over\nothers, or the myriad frameworks and legal fictions we use to interact with\nthem.\n\nWho decides this, and why, helps explain persistent and widening inequality in\nmany societies.\n\nThe idea that people aren’t all equal before the law isn’t a novel concept. Nor\nis the notion that the already wealthy and powerful have greater ability to\ninfluence this. But Pistor makes a more subtle point.\n\nShe focuses on how private agents, through private law, have taken over this\nprocess. Lawyers, not legislators, conform assets to the law, and select and\nfashion the law to suit.\n\n> Law is the cloth from which capital is cut; it gives holders of capital assets\nthe right to exclusive use and to the future returns on their assets; it allows\ncapital to rule not by force, but by law. The cloth is woven of private law, of\ncontracts, property rights, trust, corporate, and bankruptcy law, the modules of\nthe code of capital. Capital owes its vibrancy and frequent transmutations (from\nland, to firms, to debt, to ideas, etc.) to the fact that private and not state\nactors code capital in law.\n\n\nIn that sense the issue is less about access to legislators and more about\naccess to smart and creative lawyers. Especially interesting is how Pistor\nframes this as an implicit subsidy to those able to play the game.\n\n> Subsidies and other “entitlements” are typically viewed with great suspicion,\nbecause they are regarded as distortive of markets and lead to inefficiencies,\neven corruption. Yet, the legal protections capital enjoys are arguably the\nmother of all subsidies. Without the code’s modules and the possibility to\nfashion them to one’s liking, neither capital nor capitalism would exist.\n\n\nWhat Pistor reveals is a deeper problem than is acknowledged by calls for higher\ntaxes, different tax treatment, greater transfers, or pretty much anything else\nintended to decrease inequality. This is a structural issue, an invisible force\nbehind much of our lives. It’s about who gets to set the rules behind closed\ndoors.\n\n> Realizing the centrality and power of law for coding capital has important\nimplications for understanding the political economy of capitalism. It shifts\nattention from class identity and class struggle to the question of who has\naccess to and control over the legal code and its masters: the landed elites;\nthe long-distance traders and merchant banks; the shareholders of corporations\nthat own production facilities or simply hold assets behind a corporate veil;\nthe banks who grant loans, issue credit cards, and student loans; and the\nnon-bank financial intermediaries that issue complex financial assets, including\nasset-backed securities and derivatives…\n\n\n> …The law is a powerful tool for social ordering and, if used wisely, has the\npotential to serve a broad range of social objectives; yet… the law has been\nplaced firmly in the service of capital.\n\n\nAs always my

NBA commentators will often remark on how necessary it\nis for shooters. That they took the next shot as if they forgot the last one.\n\nBut Menon, Bryant, shows it can go too far. It can blind you to others.\n\nThis summer I read a great book about the process of basketball: the art of a\nbeautiful game\n[https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-a-beautiful-game-the-thinking-fans-tour-of-the-nba/oclc/892937114&referer=brief_results] \nby Chris Ballard. The Kobe chapters are, somewhat predictably, about his\nlegendary competitiveness. Note how early it starts.\n\n> He keeps bugging Brian Shaw, then a star player in Europe, to play him\none-on-one. Eventually Shaw relents, and the two play H-O-R-S-E. “To this day,\nKobe claims he beat me,” says Shaw. “I’m like, right, an 11-year-old kid, but\nhe’s serious.”\n\n\n> Now Kobe is 13 years old and an eighth-grader in the suburbs of Philadelphia,\nskinny as a paper clip. He is scrimmaging against varsity players at Lower\nMerion High in an informal practice. They are taken aback. “Here’s this kid, and\nhe has no fear of us at all,” says Doug Young, then a sophomore on the team.\n“He’s throwing elbows, setting hard screens.”\n\n\n> Bryant, now 17, is to play one-on-one against Michael Cooper, the former Lakers\nguard and one of the premier defenders in NBA history. Cooper is 40 years old\nbut still in great shape, wiry and long and much stronger than the teenage\nBryant. The game is not even close. “It was like Cooper was mesmerized by him,” \nsays Ridder, now the Warriors’ director of media relations. After 10 minutes,\nWest stands up. “That’s it, I’ve seen enough,” he says. “He’s better than anyone\nwe’ve got on the team right now. Let’s go.”\n\n\nThe examples are endless. Bryant’s belief in his own powers started young and\napparently drove him to greatness. It was plain every time he took the court.\nYou could see it in his eyes.\n\nBut Ballard also reveals the flip side. Of Bryant basically tormenting teammates\nthrough an obsession with winning. How, as Menon noted, his self-obsession often\ncame at others’ expense.\n\n> Now it’s 2000, and Bryant is an All-Star and a franchise player. Still, when\nguard Isaiah Rider is signed as a free agent by the Lakers, Bryant forces Rider\nto repeatedly play one-on-one after practice to house-break this newest\npotential alpha male. (Bryant wins, of course.) When Mitch Richmond arrives the\nnext year, it’s the same. “He was the man, and he wanted us to know it,” says\nRichmond. “He was never mean or personal about it; it’s just how he was.”\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is probably what I will take away from Bryant. He was a joy\nto watch compete. Not just gifted but amazingly driven to be the best. But there\nwas also a nasty side to that. What drove him to greatness likely drove him too\nfar.\n\nHe was blinded by belief.\n\nAs always my emphasis","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-02-09T00:51:36.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T12:29:47.000Z","published_at":"2020-02-09T00:51:36.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb380","uuid":"34b10bdc-2015-444b-a3aa-018d2ee333fe","title":"Why I love Isaiah Thomas","slug":"why-i-love-isaiah-thomas","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"![img_0282](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/img_0282.png)\\n\\nI’ve been playing with Python on my iPad, scraping [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

So I also scraped 300 geocaches from Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. The\nnumbers in Adelaide aren’t as dramatic but the effect still appears. There were\n38% fewer finds in April than April last year.\n\nThe effect is even clearer in Sydney and Melbourne. Finds in April are about a\nquarter of the previous month. There were only a couple hundred finds in April,\ndown from almost 1500 last year.\n\nMy dataset goes back almost a decade. April normally is a solid month, with a\ncouple of public holidays and the weather starting to turn. There’s also a\ngeneral upward trend over the decade, probably due to an accumulating number of\ngeocaches but maybe also smartphone uptake. Apart from those succeeding a\nmassive outlier, this kind of drop off seems anomalous.\n\nThis is a pretty clear sign of how hunkered down everyone is. It hasn’t fallen\noff completely because some people probably use it as exercise – I often plan my\nwalks around where geocaches are present. But the marginal users have completely\nfallen away.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-04-29T16:22:55.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T23:13:38.000Z","published_at":"2020-04-29T16:22:55.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb449","uuid":"b3a7fd27-cf34-4b6b-a5db-48687f593f09","title":"Definitely

Some part of this is that athletes and the league are richer &#8211; NBA players aren&#8217;t likely to be working other jobs or have better offers elsewhere. Also medicine has advanced greatly and so some of what used to be career ending or degrading just isn&#8217;t anymore.</p>\\n<p>I wondered whether it might also be about better &#8220;load management&#8221;. That stars just play fewer, more strategic minutes per game nowadays, meaning they have fewer injuries and put less of a toll on their bodies. But a quick scrape suggests that isn&#8217;t So.

I didn&#8217;t feel like getting IP blocked for scraping every NBA player ever, so I decided to focus on a small subset &#8211; NBA All Stars. This is problematic for a number of reasons, noteably that All Stars are (probably?) more skilled and athletic than the average player, therefore more likely to play longer even if they do drop off. They probably also have longer, guaranteed contracts &#8211; meaning they stick around a few extra years regardless.</p>\n<p>But as you can see from the following chart, the mean age of an All Star in their final season has increased in the past ~70 years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n<div id=\"firstlinechart\"></div>\n<br>\n<script>\n\nfunction responsivefy(svg) {\n    // get container + svg aspect ratio\n    var container = d3.select(svg.node().parentNode),\n        width = parseInt(svg.style(\"width\")),\n        height = parseInt(svg.style(\"height\")),\n        aspect = width / height;\n\n    // add viewBox and preserveAspectRatio properties,\n    // and call resize so that svg resizes on inital page load\n    svg.attr(\"viewBox\", \"0 0 \" + width + \" \" + height)\n        .attr(\"perserveAspectRatio\", \"xMinYMid\")\n        .call(resize);\n\n    // to register multiple listeners for same event type, \n    // you need to add namespace, i.e., 'click.foo'\n    // necessary if you call invoke this function for multiple svgs\n    // api docs: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#on\n    d3.select(window).on(\"resize.\" + container.attr(\"id\"), resize);\n\n    // get width of container and resize svg to fit it\n    function resize() {\n        var targetWidth = parseInt(container.style(\"width\"));\n        svg.attr(\"width\", targetWidth);\n        svg.attr(\"height\", Math.round(targetWidth / aspect));\n    }\n}\n\nvar margin = { top: 25, right: 25, bottom: 50, left: 25 };\nvar width = 1000 - margin.left - margin.right;\nvar height = 500 - margin.top - margin.bottom;\n\n\n\n\t// SVG\n    var svg = d3.select(\"#firstlinechart\")\n  .append(\"svg\")\n    .attr(\"width\", width + margin.left + margin.right)\n    .attr(\"height\", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)\n    .call(responsivefy)\n    // .attr(\"viewBox\", `0 0 400 800`)\n  .append(\"g\")\n    .attr(\"transform\",\n          \"translate(\" + margin.left + \",\" + margin.top + \")\");\n\nd3.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshnicholas/data/master/nbaallstaroldestMEDIAN.csv\", function (data) {\n  // Variables\n\n\n\t// X-axis\n    var x = d3.scaleLinear()\n      .domain([1945,2020])\n      .range([ 0, width ]);\n    svg.append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"transform\", \"translate(0,\" + height + \")\")\n      .call(\n          d3.axisBottom(x)\n          .ticks(3)\n          .tickFormat(d3.format(\"d\")));\n\n    // Add Y axis\n    var y = d3.scaleLinear()\n      .domain([25, 40])\n      .range([ height, 0 ]);\n    svg.append(\"g\")\n      .call(\n          d3.axisLeft(y)\n          .ticks(3)\n          .tickFormat(d3.format(\"d\")));\n\n    svg.append(\"path\")\n    .datum(data)\n    .attr(\"fill\", \"none\")\n    .attr(\"stroke\", \"#86b300\")\n    .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n    .style(\"opacity\", 0.75)\n    .attr(\"d\", d3.line()\n        .x(function(d) { return x(d.season) })\n        .y(function(d) { return y(d.age) })\n        .curve(d3.curveCatmullRom.alpha(0.5))\n    )\n\n\n    svg.append('text') // y-axis Label\n      .attr('class','label')\n      .attr('transform','rotate(90)')\n      .attr('x',0)\n      .attr('y',-6)\n      .attr('font-size','12px')\n      .style('text-anchor','start')\n      .style(\"opacity\", 0.75)\n    //   .attr(\"fill\", \"#86b300\")\n      .text('Mean age in final season');\n\n      svg.append('text') // Sourcing\n      .attr('class','label')\n      .attr('y',height+30)\n      .attr('x',0)\n      .attr('font-size','10px')\n      .style('text-anchor','start')\n      .style(\"opacity\", 0.50)\n      .text('Data scraped from basketball-reference.com')\n\n    svg.append('text') // X-axis Label\n    .attr('class','label')\n    .attr('x', width)\n    .attr('y', height - 3)\n    .attr('font-size','12px')\n    .style('text-anchor','end')\n    .style(\"opacity\", 0.75)\n    // .attr(\"fill\", \"#86b300\")\n    .text('NBA season');\n    \n    svg.append(\"text\")\n    .attr(\"x\", width / 2 )\n    .attr(\"y\", 5)\n    .attr('font-size','20px')\n    .style(\"text-anchor\", \"middle\")\n    .style(\"opacity\", 0.75)\n    .text(\"NBA All Stars are retiring older\");\n\n    svg.append(\"text\")\n    .attr(\"x\", 5 )\n    .attr(\"y\", height - 5)\n    .attr('dy','.1em')\n    .style(\"text-anchor\", \"start\")\n    .style(\"font-weight\", \"bold\")\n    .style(\"opacity\", 0.05)\n    .text(\"Josh Nicholas\")\n    .attr(\"fill\", \"#86b300\")\n    ;    \n\n\n\n})\n\n\n</script>\n\n<p>So, the next obvious question is what&#8217;s going on? Some part of this is that athletes and the league are richer &#8211; NBA players aren&#8217;t likely to be working other jobs or have better offers elsewhere. Also medicine has advanced greatly and so some of what used to be career ending or degrading just isn&#8217;t anymore.</p>\n<p>I wondered whether it might also be about better &#8220;load management&#8221;. That stars just play fewer, more strategic minutes per game nowadays, meaning they have fewer injuries and put less of a toll on their bodies. But a quick scrape suggests that isn&#8217;t So. Career minutes per game seems about the same for guys retiring recently as it did six decades ago.</p>\n<br>\n<div id=\"secondscatter\"></div>\n<br>\n<script>\n\nfunction responsivefy(svg2) {\n    // get container + svg aspect ratio\n    var container = d3.select(svg2.node().parentNode),\n        width = parseInt(svg2.style(\"width\")),\n        height = parseInt(svg2.style(\"height\")),\n        aspect = width / height;\n\n    // add viewBox and preserveAspectRatio properties,\n    // and call resize so that svg resizes on inital page load\n    svg2.attr(\"viewBox\", \"0 0 \" + width + \" \" + height)\n        .attr(\"perserveAspectRatio\", \"xMinYMid\")\n        .call(resize);\n\n    // to register multiple listeners for same event type, \n    // you need to add namespace, i.e., 'click.foo'\n    // necessary if you call invoke this function for multiple svgs\n    // api docs: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#on\n    d3.select(window).on(\"resize.\" + container.attr(\"id\"), resize);\n\n    // get width of container and resize svg to fit it\n    function resize() {\n        var targetWidth = parseInt(container.style(\"width\"));\n        svg2.attr(\"width\", targetWidth);\n        svg2.attr(\"height\", Math.round(targetWidth / aspect));\n    }\n}\n\nvar margin = { top: 25, right: 25, bottom: 30, left: 25 };\nvar width = 1000 -

There’ve been\na fair few long-toothed retirees recently – Kobe Bryant\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html] was 37 and Dirk\nNowitzki [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nowitdi01.html] was 40\nin their final seasons, for instance.\n\nA couple more come to mind from earlier decades – Bob Cousy\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cousybo01.html] retiring (for a\nsecond time) at 41 in 1970 or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html] at 41 in 1989. A\nquick scrape of basketball-reference.com [https://www.basketball-reference.com] \nsuggests these legendary players are, in fact, outliers. But even so, All Stars,\nat least, have been retiring older.\n\nHere’s a chart of all 503 All Stars\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_star_by_player.html] listed on\nbasketball reference. Their age in their final season against the season:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s limitation here. I didn’t feel like getting IP blocked for scraping\nevery NBA player ever, so I decided to focus on a small subset – NBA All Stars.\nThis is problematic for a number of reasons, noteably that All Stars are\n(probably?) more skilled and athletic than the average player, therefore more\nlikely to play longer even if they do drop off. They probably also have longer,\nguaranteed contracts – meaning they stick around a few extra years regardless.\n\nBut as you can see from the following chart, the mean age of an All Star in\ntheir final season has increased in the past ~70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the next obvious question is what’s going on? Some part of this is that\nathletes and the league are richer – NBA players aren’t likely to be working\nother jobs or have better offers elsewhere. Also medicine has advanced greatly\nand so some of what used to be career ending or degrading just isn’t anymore.\n\nI wondered whether it might also be about better “load management”. That stars\njust play fewer, more strategic minutes per game nowadays, meaning they have\nfewer injuries and put less of a toll on their bodies. But a quick scrape\nsuggests that isn’t So. Career minutes per game seems about the same for guys\nretiring recently as it did six decades ago.\n\n\n\nIf anything it seems that All Stars are playing far more. There’re definitely\nplaying more total games. Some of this is due to more games in seasons and\nplayoffs\n[https://slate.com/culture/2011/12/the-82-game-nba-schedule-explained.html] as\nthe league has expanded. Private charters have also become a thing etc.\n\n\n\nBut better gear, medicine and sports science must come into it somewhere.\nPlayers and teams have access to so many more resources than they ever did, such\nas conditioning coaches, dieticians, chefs, masseuses and other therapists. This\nreminds me of a brilliant article\n[https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-trainer-gets-spent-lebron-james-from-one-herculean-effort-to-next/] \nfrom a few years ago, delving into all that Lebron James and his team go through\nto help him recover between games. The techniques are full on and constantly\nevolving.\n\nBut while they show their careers are lengthening, none of this really captures\nthe impact over a career, which players and positions survive longest, and how a\nbig a drop off there is. Maybe that’s what I’ll stick my nose in next.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-06-15T22:09:59.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-12T05:02:03.000Z","published_at":"2020-06-15T22:09:59.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f01823cca9ec500397fb4cc","uuid":"11fb48d0-a930-40a2-b7ae-dacb6abf4bc1","title":"aho

I'm now far less taken by the \"genius\" of Vincent. Rather,\nI'm enamoured with his brother.\n\nThe book is a brilliant illustration of the importance of family. Vincent\nappears to have been a loner, but defies the lone genius trope.\n\n> Theo knew better than anyone the trials of living with his brother: the\ninsecurity and defensiveness, the alternating currents of guileless optimism and\nabyssal depression, the inner war of grand ambition and easy frustration.\nThe family were prolific letter writers, and so the story is largely constructed\naround surviving correspondence. Mainly that between the brothers, but also of\ntheir family and contemporaries. Looking through my notes, however, much of it\nis taken with harangues, tantrums, feuds and demands.\n\n> He wrote Theo, too, unapologetically detailing his new life (“I have a real\nstudio of my own, and I am so glad”) and hinting darkly that he might be forced\nto borrow again from Mauve if Theo did not replenish his empty pockets—or even\ngo to Tersteeg for money. Fearing another family embarrassment, Theo sent the\nmoney, but not without blistering his brother for behaving so badly toward their\nparents. “What the devil made you so childish and so shameless?” he scolded.\n“One day you will be extremely sorry for having been so callous in this matter.”\nVincent exploded at the rebuke, responding to his brother’s accusations in a\nlong and furious rebuttal. “I offer no apology,” he declared. To Theo’s charge\nthat such bickering threatened their aging father’s health, Vincent replied\nacidly: “The murderer has left the house.” Instead of softening his demands, he\ncomplained that Theo had not sent enough money, and insisted that Theo guarantee\nfurther payments because “I must know with some certainty what to expect.”\nThe book charts Vincent's slow spiral, from an upper middle class upbringing,\nthrough repeated failures in numerous fields. Vincent appears to have lived with\nmental illness most of his life, and only really started to gain fame after his\nsuicide.\n\nAlong the way Vincent seemed to alienate almost everybody, including his\nparents, uncles, bosses, co-workers, landlords, art suppliers, fellow students,\nsiblings, and entire towns and villages.\n\nBut not his brother. Theo supported him throughout, financially and emotionally.\nFor most of his time as an artist Theo paid his bills.

But he died shortly after Vincent. It was Johanna who organised\nexhibitions of, and curated, Vincent's work. Johanna was even the first to\npublish the brothers' correspondence.\n\nVincent was a genius but he didn't do it alone. It took a village.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-12T06:37:21.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-12T06:51:25.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-12T06:37:40.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f0ce75d2ecadf0039ac5ea9","uuid":"3bb7a6bf-94e2-4b02-91ad-e66a3312bf50","title":"Selfie #7","slug":"selfie-7","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Selfie7.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Been reading about Matisse\"]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Selfie7.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Been reading about Matisse</p>","comment_id":"5f0ce75d2ecadf0039ac5ea9","plaintext":"Been reading about Matisse","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-13T22:59:41.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T23:00:21.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-13T23:00:21.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f0cf9c92ecadf0039ac5eaf","uuid":"418df3d1-6347-48ff-a195-1a5ce0884fce","title":"Simple lines","slug":"simple-lines","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Gogh.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Gogh2.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Trying to nail more abstract portraits, with simpler lines\"]]],[10,0],[10,1]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<p>Trying to nail more abstract portraits, with simpler lines</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Gogh.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Gogh2.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"5f0cf9c92ecadf0039ac5eaf","plaintext":"Trying to nail more abstract portraits, with simpler lines","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-14T00:18:17.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T00:18:56.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-14T00:18:56.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f0d34392ecadf0039ac5eb5","uuid":"1493fcee-f96c-40cd-8fcf-65c608aab5b8","title":"Out for lunch","slug":"out-for-lunch","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Fancy.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"How much longer will this be tenable?\"]]],[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<p>How much longer will this be tenable?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/Fancy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"5f0d34392ecadf0039ac5eb5","plaintext":"How much longer will this be tenable?","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-14T04:27:37.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T04:28:23.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-14T04:28:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f0d4ff02ecadf0039ac5ebd","uuid":"8cd04617-b750-4edc-8c25-71b116685413","title":"Diving into the van Gogh letters","slug":"diving-into-van-goghs-letters","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"Vincent van Gogh's letters have been playing on my mind since I [finished his biography a few days ago](__GHOST_URL__/it-takes-a-village/).

Almost 1000 van Gogh-adjacent letters have been translated and put on a [website](http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters.html) attached to the Van Gogh Museum. 659 of these are letters from Vincent to Theo. 83 are to Vincent. The rest are a mixture of senders and recipients. \\n\\nObviously many letters have been lost, but right there you get a good sense of the relationship. Theo apparently saved hundreds of letters from Vincent. And this was before van Gogh was van Gogh. \\n\\nCharting the letters across time gives you another clue as to the relationship. Vincent van Gogh only really focused on becoming an artist in the early 1880s, which is roughly when the letters to Theo really takeoff.

So intense was his passion to persuade that letters alone could not contain it.

Steven Naifeh used a close reading to paint a rich portrait, the ups and many downs. But what else can we see?</p>\n<p>It's staggering how many have survived. Almost 1000 van Gogh-adjacent letters have been translated and put on a <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters.html\">website</a> attached to the Van Gogh Museum. 659 of these are letters from Vincent to Theo. 83 are to Vincent. The rest are a mixture of senders and recipients.</p>\n<p>Obviously many letters have been lost, but right there you get a good sense of the relationship. Theo apparently saved hundreds of letters from Vincent. And this was before van Gogh was van Gogh.</p>\n<p>Charting the letters across time gives you another clue as to the relationship. Vincent van Gogh only really focused on becoming an artist in the early 1880s, which is roughly when the letters to Theo really takeoff.

The length picks up as Vincent repeatedly meets failure in his worklife and turns to Theo for support. There's another jump around the time Vincent takes up art in the early 1880s.</p>\n<p>The average length is truly amazing when you consider the number of letters being exchanged. It reminded me how often Naifeh describes Vincent as copying out poems and bible verses when in a particular pique and needing to convince.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His exhortations eventually broadened to include love and belonging, melancholy and longing—subjects that clearly haunted him in his deepening alienation. So intense was his passion to persuade that letters alone could not contain it. By early 1875, he had bought an album for Theo and began filling its blank pages with long transcriptions from the works by these and other writers, all in a tiny, neat, error-free script. When he had filled every page of the first album, he bought another one and filled it, too, copying by gaslight late into the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id=\"letterstotheoperyearwordcount\"></div>\n\n<style>\n    .axis { font-size: 1em;

Steven Naifeh used\na close reading to paint a rich portrait, the ups and many downs. But what else\ncan we see?\n\nIt's staggering how many have survived. Almost 1000 van Gogh-adjacent letters\nhave been translated and put on a website\n[http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters.html] attached to the Van Gogh Museum.\n659 of these are letters from Vincent to Theo. 83 are to Vincent. The rest are a\nmixture of senders and recipients.\n\nObviously many letters have been lost, but right there you get a good sense of\nthe relationship. Theo apparently saved hundreds of letters from Vincent. And\nthis was before van Gogh was van Gogh.\n\nCharting the letters across time gives you another clue as to the relationship.\nVincent van Gogh only really focused on becoming an artist in the early 1880s,\nwhich is roughly when the letters to Theo really takeoff. This is also when Theo\nbegan to financially support him.\n\nThe sudden dropoff in 1886 and 87 is easily explained - those are two years when\nVincent lived with Theo in Paris. There wouldn't have been many letters\nexchanged (just 19 survive).\n\nYou can see a similar trend in the length of the letters. The length picks up as\nVincent repeatedly meets failure in his worklife and turns to Theo for support.\nThere's another jump around the time Vincent takes up art in the early 1880s.\n\nThe average length is truly amazing when you consider the number of letters\nbeing exchanged. It reminded me how often Naifeh describes Vincent as copying\nout poems and bible verses when in a particular pique and needing to convince.\n\n> His exhortations eventually broadened to include love and belonging, melancholy\nand longing—subjects that clearly haunted him in his deepening alienation. So\nintense was his passion to persuade that letters alone could not contain it. By\nearly 1875, he had bought an album for Theo and began filling its blank pages\nwith long transcriptions from the works by these and other writers, all in a\ntiny, neat, error-free script. When he had filled every page of the first album,\nhe bought another one and filled it, too, copying by gaslight late into the\nnight.\n\n\nBut what about the content of the letters? They almost all begin with some\nversion of \"my dear Theo\" and often end with a \"your loving brother\". But I'm\nnot sure if that quite captures the relationship.\n\nI ran a simple sentiment analysis algorithm on all the letters to Theo. It\nanalyses the words and outputs \"positivity\" on a scale from 1 to -1. 1 being\npositive and -1 being mostly negative.\n\nAs you can see, apart from a couple of outliers Vincent's letters are mostly in\nthe middle. Neither overly positive or negative. But also not what I would\nexpect from letters to a close family member.\n\nThere's an obvious flaw here in that the letters would have originally been in\neither French or Dutch, so I'm working with a translation. But this roughly fits\nwith the vibe of Naifeh's biography.\n\nI think that might be all we'll wring out of the letters for now. I was thinking\nabout looking into the distribution of words - find out the major topics. But I\nsuspect there will be a lot of noise.

That\nwith the long break and short lead-up teams will be sloppier than normal.\nThey'll turn the ball over more. Not pass as much. Take easier shots (more 3\npointers rather than driving to the hoop etc.).\n\nIt's a conversation had at the beginning of every season. And one I've always\nwanted to nail down. I believe its a phenomena. But are we all being fooled? Is\nthis just survivorship bias? After all, we don't talk about it when the team\ndon't play sloppy.\n\nI decided to scrape the team box score\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201910230PHI.html] for every\nBoston Celtics game going back to 1946. That's some 6,000 games. And, I can't\nreally find it.\n\nThe median turnovers per game, for instance, is about 16 per game over 70-odd\nseasons. The standard deviation is roughly one. Given this, over 70-odd seasons,\nsix of the first ten games of the seasons are within one standard deviation in\nterms of turnovers per game.\n\nThat's 60% of the initial games within one standard deviation, which is roughly\nwhat you'd expect. Over seventy seasons there's little difference if you compare\nall the first games and all the last games.\n\nI wanted to make a heatmap to visualise this. I grouped all the games (so, all\nthe 1st games of the season are together, as are all the 10th games etc.) I did\nthis for five basic game stats - turnovers, assists, 3 point percentage, field\ngoal percentage and three point attempts.\n\nJust for easy comparison I've normalised everything to a range from 0 to 1.\n\nYou can see roughly what I found with turnovers. Some spikes here and there.\nField goal percentage appears to get somewhat better as the season progresses.\nBut it's mostly uniform.\n\nYou may be able to make a better case for some other, advanced stats.
